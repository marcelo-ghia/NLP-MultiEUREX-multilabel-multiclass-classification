This requires the definition of the agricultural holdings covered by the survey. The different categories for the breakdown of the survey results, and the herd size classes and the territorial subdivisions according to which the Member States draw up the survey results at regular intervals must also be precisely defined. A standard definition of carcass weight is necessary for drawing up slaughtering statistics.\\n(3)\\nUnder Directive 93/24/EEC, the Member States may, at their request, be authorised to carry out the May/June or November/December surveys in selected regions, provided that these surveys cover at least 70 % of the bovine population.

KG, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania\\n(notified under document number C(2002) 5378)\\n(Only the German text is authentic)\\n(Text with EEA relevance)\\n(2003/875/EC)\\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof,\\nHaving regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof,\\nHaving called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above(1) and having regard to their comments,\\nWhereas:\\n1. PROCEDURE\\n1.1. Stages of the procedure\\n(1) Following a series of complaints concerning State aid granted to Klausner Nordic Timber GmbH & Co. KG (hereinafter \"KNT\"), Germany was asked by the Commission in 1999 and 2000 to provide all relevant information that would enable it to examine whether the aid was compatible with the common market. The measures concerned State aid granted to KNT for the construction and expansion of a sawmill in Wismar (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). The information provided by Germany was deemed to be incomplete and did not allay the Commission\\'s concerns as to whether the measures were compatible with previously approved aid schemes.\\n(2) By letter of 17 August 2000, Germany was required by the Commission in accordance with Article 10(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty(2) and with the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 5 October 1994 in Case 47/91 Italy v Commission(3) to present all the information necessary to assess whether the measures in favour of KNT were covered by aid schemes which had previously been approved by the Commission.\\n(3) By letter of 13 November 2000, the annexes to which were received by separate post on 16 November, Germany provided some of the information necessary to assess whether the aid recipient was to be regarded as an SME within the meaning of the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises(4) (\"Community SME guidelines\") and Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC of 3 April 1996 concerning the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises(5) and, therefore, as being eligible for aid in the assisted areas where the two projects are located, with a maximum gross aid intensity of 50 %.\\n(4) The Commission informed Germany by letter of 20 June 2001 of its decision to initiate the procedure under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty and to require the provision of information in accordance with Article 10(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.\\n(5) Germany replied to the decision initiating the procedure and the information injunction by letter of 2 August 2001, the annexes to which were received on 12 November.\\n(6) The decision initiating the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(6). At the same time, the Commission called on all interested parties to submit their comments.\\n(7) The Commission received comments from a number of third parties. The comments were forwarded to Germany, which replied by letter of 31 October 2001.\\n(8) On 15 January 2002, the Commission adopted Decision 2002/468/EC(7) terminating the formal investigation procedure. Some of the assistance for KNT was considered to be incompatible and was required to be repaid.\\n(9) On 27 March 2002, KNT lodged a complaint with the Court of First Instance of the European Communities to the effect that the Commission had not correctly interpreted an approved aid scheme. Together with the complainant, the Commission sought to have the procedure suspended so that it could withdraw its decision, which was unsound in law.\\n(10) Further details also came to light. On 9 and 11 September 2002, the Commission asked Germany for its views on the new particulars presented by KNT in a letter of 26 September 2002 (the annexes were received on 1 October).\\n1.2. Reasons for withdrawing Decision 2002/468/EC\\n(11) In Decision 2002/468/EC, the Commission had declared as incompatible with the common market a measure that had apparently been authorised by Germany on the basis of an approved aid programme. According to the Commission, the measure did not satisfy the conditions laid down in the Investment Allowance Law.\\n(12) The Commission took the view that the aid recipient, since it employed more than 250 workers at the time the measure was authorised, was not eligible for an aid intensity of more than 10 %. The authorised aid framework provides for an aid ceiling of 10 % for recipients with more than 250 workers. The Commission considered that the measure was covered by the aid programmes only up to 10 % of the eligible costs since the recipient, which was defined as an \"economic unit\", employed more than 250 workers at the time the aid was granted. According to the Commission, no other justification for the compatibility of the excess amount of aid with the common market could be found. Accordingly, it concluded that part of the aid did not satisfy the criteria determining compatibility with the common market.\\n(13) In its appeal to the Court of First Instance, the representatives of the recipient argued that, in interpreting the German Investment Allowance Law and the decision authorising it, the Commission had made a mistake in law, particularly as regards the definition of \"recipient\" within the meaning of the Community SME guidelines. The Investment Allowance Law provides for a tax exemption for the acquisition and production of capital goods and buildings by firms established in the new Länder. The representatives also claimed that the Law defined the recipient of the investment allowance as economically and organisationally separate operating units and not as a single economic unit. According to them, the Commission had misinterpreted its Decision authorising the Investment Allowance Law and its Decision 2002/468/EC was unsound in law in view of the measure authorised on the basis of the Law. Neither the Member State nor the recipient had any interest in maintaining in force a partly negative decision. Accordingly, the Commission has decided to withdraw Decision 2002/468/EC. Additional information and clarifications were needed in order to take a new decision and Germany has provided these. In the light of this new information, the Commission considers it appropriate and justified to carry out a new assessment, not only of the measure authorised under the Investment Allowance Law but also of the guarantee for a DEM 29750000 loan that had also been declared incompatible with the common market in Decision 2002/468/EC. No legitimate expectations or acquired rights of third parties stand in the way of a reassessment.\\n2. THE MEASURE\\n2.1. The aid recipient\\n(14) The legal person to which the aid was granted, KNT, was formed on 28 May 1997 and constructed a new sawmill in Wismar, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, in 1998. KNT processes coniferous timber. The business is conducted by the general partner(8) Klausner Nordic Timber GmbH (\"KNT-GmbH\"). The shares in the limited partnership KNT are owned by Fritz Klausner, a natural person, who also owns all the capital of KNT; he is the sole limited partner(9) of KNT.\\n(15) Fritz Klausner also holds shares in other companies.\\n(16) Klausner Holzindustrie GmbH (\"KHI-GmbH\") is an Austrian limited liability company responsible for the management of Klausner Holzindustrie GmbH & Co. KG (\"KHI\"), which operates a sawmill in St Johann (Tyrol). KHI-GmbH is the general partner of KHI.\\n(17) The shareholders of KHI-GmbH are:\\n(a) Fritz Klausner (25 %);\\n(b) Margarethe Klausner (Fritz Klausner\\'s mother) (50 %);\\n(c) Anne Klausner (Fritz Klausner\\'s sister) (25 %).\\n(18) The partners of KHI are:\\n(a) KHI-GmbH (general partner; no capital interest);\\n(b) Fritz Klausner (limited partner; capital interest of 75 %; no voting rights since 1 January 1997);\\n(c) Margarethe Klausner (limited partner; capital interest of 25 %).\\n(19) Klausner Holz Thüringen Geschäftsführung GmbH (\"KHT-GmbH\") is a German limited liability company which manages the business of Klausner Holz Thüringen GmbH & Co. KG (\"KHT\"). KHT operates a sawmill in Friesau (Thuringia). Fritz Klausner owns all the shares in KHT-GmbH; he managed the company until 19 June 1997.\\n(20) The partners of KHT are:\\n(a) KHT-GmbH (general partner; no capital interest; managing director);\\n(b) Fritz Klausner (limited partner; capital interest of 20 %);\\n(c) KHI (limited partner; capital interest of 80 %).\\n(21) KHT Hobelwerk Beteiligungs GmbH (\"KHO-GmbH\"), which is wholly owned by Fritz Klausner, was formed on 15 May 1997. It is the general partner of KHT Hobelwerk GmbH & Co. KG (\"KHO\"), which operates a planing mill in Thuringia.\\n(22) Klausner Nordic Services GmbH (\"KNS\"), which is wholly owned by Fritz Klausner, is a service company for local enterprises.\\n(23) Klausner Nordic Energie GmbH (\"KNE\"), which is wholly owned by Fritz Klausner, operated a power plant.\\n(24) The companies with which Fritz Klausner was involved from 1996 to 1999 are the following:\\nTABLE\\nTABLE\\n2.2. The measures\\n2.2.1. Measure for the construction of a new production plant in Wismar (\"first aid package\")\\n(25) The Economics Ministry of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania decided on 18 April 1997 (the decision was modified on 12 March 1998) to grant KNT investment aid for the construction of a sawmill in Wismar under the 27th outline plan for the joint Federal Government/Länder scheme for improving regional economic structures (1998 to 2002)(10). The sawmill is located in an assisted area under Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty. The grant was equivalent to the ceiling of DEM 43818300 (EUR 22,4 million), corresponding to a gross intensity of 38,21 % of the eligible investment costs of DEM 114669000 (EUR 58,6 million). According to Germany, the aid was conditional on the creation of 115 jobs.\\n(26) By decision of 26 April 1998, which was modified on 25 July 1998, Germany also granted KNT an investment allowance for 1997 of DEM 2635086 (EUR 1,3 million) under the Investment Allowance Law 1996, an aid scheme approved by the Commission(11). The aid intensity amounts to 2,3 % of the eligible costs.\\n(27) By a decision of 1 September 1999, a further investment allowance was granted on the basis of the Investment Allowance Law amounting to DEM 2500000 (EUR 1,3 million), representing 2,18 % of the eligible investment costs.\\n(28) In 1997 Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania also assumed a guarantee to secure 80 % of a low-interest loan of DEM 30 million (EUR 15,3 million) under its guarantee guidelines which had been approved by the Commission(12). The aid element contained in this measure amounted to 0,5 %, according to the German authorities, who assumed that KNT ranked as an economically sound enterprise. This represents aid amounting to EUR 61355,03, equivalent to an intensity of 0,1 % of the eligible costs.\\n(29) According to Germany, the aid intensity of the measure mentioned amounted to 43,18 % of the eligible costs. The actual aid intensity is 42,79 % of the eligible costs.\\n(30) The enterprise argued that it had actually invested DEM 124401024 (EUR 63,6 million) and that, for this reason, the aid intensity should be lowered to 39,80 %. This information was not confirmed by Germany, however, and the Commission was not presented with any further evidence. The Commission is therefore basing itself on the decisions of the German authorities that granted the aid in which the eligible costs were specified and the aid amount determined and approved.\\n2.2.2. Measure for the extension of the Wismar mill and the construction of a second sawmill\\n(31) In Decision 2002/468/EC, the Commission pointed out that, even after two requests had been made, Germany had not provided full information on the aid granted to KNT in respect of the extension project. After additional information had been provided by KNT and following a request from the Commission for confirmation, Germany eventually provided all the particulars along with written documents concerning the extension project and the aid granted to it. The increase in the investment for the extension project was justified by the additional costs of acquiring and assembling a second saw and the associated investment in appropriate plant (dry hammer and sorting shed). Evidence for the realisation of these additional investments was provided in documents submitted by Germany.\\n(32) According to the most recent figures provided by Germany, the eligible costs for the extension of the Wismar mill and the installation of a second saw amount to DEM 61612000 (EUR 31501715,39). The following aid measures were granted for this project:\\n(a) an investment grant of DEM 8879000 (EUR 4,45 million) under the 27th outline plan for the joint Federal Government/Länder scheme (1998 to 2002), which had been approved by the Commission. The grant was made by the Land by decision of 8 September 1998 and the aid intensity amounts to 14,41 % of the eligible costs;\\n(b) investment allowances totalling DEM 11140587 (EUR 5696091,68): An initial tranche of DEM 7755095 (EUR 3965117,11) was granted for investment in 1999 and a second instalment of DEM 3385492 (EUR 1730974,57) for investment in 2000. The aid intensity represents 18,08 % of the eligible costs;\\n(c) a low-interest loan of DEM 8549999,60 (EUR 4371545,38) under the SME programme of the Reconstruction Loan Corporation (KfW), a scheme approved by the Commission(13): In accordance with Decision 2002/468/EC, the aid intensity of this loan is 1 % of the loan amount. This gives aid of DEM 85499,99 (EUR 43715,45), representing 0,14 % of the eligible costs;\\n(d) an 80 % guarantee granted jointly in 1999 by the Federal Government and the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to secure a loan of DEM 29750000 (EUR 15,21 million) on the basis of the Commission-approved Federal guarantee programme(14) for companies carrying out new projects in the new Länder and on the basis of the above guarantee guidelines of the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The aid element of this measure amounts to 0,5 % of the guarantee, bearing in mind that KNT is to be regarded as an economically sound enterprise. Only part of this credit, i.e. DEM 12750000 (EUR 6518971,49)(15), is earmarked for financing investment. The remainder, i.e. DEM 17 million (EUR 8691961,98), is earmarked for financing operating assets. The aid amounts to 0,5 % of 80 % of the loan amount of DEM 12750000 (EUR 6518971,49), i.e. DEM 51000 (EUR 26075,89), equivalent to 0,08 % of the eligible costs.\\n(33) According to Germany, the project was also financed by equity amounting to DEM 33041513,02 (EUR 16893857,35). This amount comprises the loan of DEM 6949999,99 (EUR 3553478,57) under the KfW environmental programme; the aid element is DEM 186971,48 (EUR 95597) and is, according to Germany, to be classed as de minimis aid.\\n(34) These figures were confirmed by the decision of the Economics Ministry of the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania dated 25 September 2002 and amending the grant decision of 20 August 1998, which had previously been amended by decisions of 22 October 1999 and 28 March 2002.\\n(35) In the 1999 decision, potential extraordinary depreciation was mentioned with an aid intensity of 1,42 %. This aid was ultimately not granted because it related to investments for 1999 and 2000. The Development Areas Law does not provide for depreciation on investments after 31 December 1998. In the amending decision of 25 September 2002, the German authorities assumed an overall aid intensity for the extension project of 33,99 %. The actual intensity amounts to 33,05 % of the eligible costs.\\n2.3. Grounds for initiating the procedure\\n(36) Despite the information provided by Germany in response to the information injunction, the Commission still had doubts as to whether the newly established sawmills could be regarded as SMEs and whether the aid as a whole was covered by approved aid schemes.\\n(37) KNT is eligible for these gross aid intensities for the construction and extension of the sawmill in Wismar only if it is a genuine SME. It must therefore meet the conditions laid down in the Community SME guidelines. One of the conditions in the decision approving the aid schemes under which public funds were granted or are still to be granted is compliance with the definition of an SME contained in Recommendation 96/280/EC and the Community SME guidelines.\\n(38) It had to be ascertained in particular whether the legal entity KNT, which had been granted various aid measures, could in itself be viewed as the aid recipient. The particular question was whether it constituted an \"economic unit\" within the meaning of Community legislation(16) or whether the \"assisted enterprise\" also encompassed other enterprises of the Klausner group. The doubts related in particular to the relations between KNT and KHT as well as to the degree of their economic integration. In this regard, the size of the enterprise to which the aid was granted had first to be determined before the Commission could assess whether the aid recipient met the definition of an SME.\\n(39) With the still incomplete information from Germany on the enterprises belonging to the Klausner group, the Commission was unable to make a determination on the SME status of the aid recipient and thus on the question of whether the aid granted to KNT is covered by a regional aid scheme previously approved by the Commission or is to be viewed as new aid. However, the Commission also had doubts regarding the compatibility of all the measures with the common market.\\n(40) Accordingly, the Commission decided to initiate the procedure under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty and to issue an information injunction under Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.\\n3. COMMENTS FROM INTERESTED PARTIES\\n(41) After initiating the procedure, the Commission received comments from eight interested parties.\\n(42) Two competitors of the Klausner sawmills complained about not gaining access to the profit-and-loss statement and balance sheet of the Klausner group, which were not published. According to these competitors, taking the figures specified by the enterprise for raw materials consumption, the turnover and balance-sheet total for 1996 had to have exceeded the SME thresholds. Moreover, neither KNT nor KHT made an equity contribution towards the financing of the two projects. Given its scale, the project did not comply with the SME provisions from the outset. The large amount of aid conferred major advantages on KNT in relation to its competitors, most of whom had a turnover of less than EUR 1,5 million and an equity ratio of below 15 %. Since the start of operations in Wismar, large volumes of timber were sold at a price which would not be tenable under normal financial conditions and assuming the same raw material sources. Finally, both sawmill enterprises were of the opinion that KNT\\'s argument that the raw material procurement and product sales by KNT and KHT occurred on two different markets was incorrect. They maintained that the raw timber from Russia and the Baltic region was also used in Austria and by KHT in Friesau. Moreover, a large part of KNT\\'s production was sold in central and southern Germany as well as in Austria and Italy, where the Austrian timber industry is likewise very active.\\n(43) Both the Swedish Timber Association and the Association of the Swedish Forestry Industry sent in their comments after the procedure had been initiated. According to them, the investment aid and credit guarantees for KNT signified that, in addition to the related particle board and laminated wood plants in Wismar, one of Europe\\'s largest sawmills had been constructed. No capacity shortage justifying such investments had been recorded in any of these market segments, however. Sawn timber is to be viewed as a mature product not in heavy demand and there is a strong need for consolidation in the industry. Substantial demand for product development aimed at increasing the use of timber also exists in various market segments. According to the ECE Timber Committee, the production and consumption of sawn timber were as follows in Europe between 1991 and 2000:\\nTABLE\\nTABLE\\n(44) The Swedish associations emphasised that the subsidised formation of KNT and other mills has contributed to the increase in overproduction which the European industry has been seeking intensively to bring under control for many years. This overproduction had led, among other things, to declining prices for sawn timber and increasing raw material costs. According to the KHT website, the production capacity of the Wismar plant is 1,3 million m3.\\n(45) Regarding the SME status of the enterprise, the Swedish industry was unable to comment on the question of whether KNT could be classified as a \"small or medium-sized enterprise\" in the various phases in which the State aid was granted. According to information in its possession, however, the plant in Wismar is 50 % larger than the largest Swedish sawmill built in the last three years. In conclusion, the associations pointed out that KNT was one of Europe\\'s largest sawmills and, together with the corporate group to which it belongs, exerted a substantial influence on the market in which it is active.\\n(46) A German law firm reacted to the decision to initiate the procedure with the statement that KHT and KNT were active as individual enterprises on the market. Its letter stated that the SME criteria had not been met at the time the aid was granted, but no further details have been provided. Moreover, the law firm stated that the aid intensity of the guarantee was over 0,50 % since the enterprises KNT and KHT were unable to finance the doubling of the Wismar mill\\'s capacity. The letter stated in conclusion that the State aid was granted to KNT to support economic development in the new Länder without any consideration for the provisions of Community law.\\n(47) The Austrian Chamber of the Timber Industry expressed its regret that the balance sheets of KNT and KHT could not be inspected. In its opinion, the aid was granted without the necessary equity bases. It confirmed that the Klausner group procured its raw materials from areas in which the Austrian industry traditionally made its raw timber purchases. Klausner production was able to compete with production from Austrian sawmills only as a result of low prices that did not reflect market conditions.\\n(48) The German Sawmill Association pointed out that KNT and KHT were described as production facilities on their websites. Even assuming that the family owners of all \"Klausner companies\" and the overlapping, only partially non-voting shares of Fritz Klausner in KHT, held via Klausner Holzindustrie GmbH & Co. KG in St. Johann, did not enjoy or offer the possibility of exerting control, KHT-GmbH, which Fritz Klausner owns, is still though responsible for the management of KHT.\\n(49) KNT likewise responded via its legal representatives to the decision to initiate the procedure. The previously missing information on the number of employees and the financial data of various group companies were supplemented and the aid intensity of the two projects was recalculated. With regard to the construction of the sawmill in Wismar, KNT distinguished between the total aid intensity calculated (as envisaged in the aid notice) on the basis of the investment expenditure (43,18 %) and an intensity calculated on the basis of the actual investments (39,80 %). For the extension project, the total aid intensity amounted to 49,82 % and the \"de facto aid intensity\" to 30,08 %. KNT also provided more detailed information on the investment allowance for the investments made in 1999, putting the total investment expenditure for the extension project at DEM 37891390. The aid intensity was also recalculated for the extension project on the basis of the total investment expenditure, resulting in a figure of 44,67 %. Finally, an aid intensity of 31,13 % was calculated for the investment totalling DEM 62032981 in 1999 and 2000.\\n(50) KNT also commented on its integration with other companies of the Klausner group. In its view, KNT must be considered as being independent of KHT, given that Fritz Klausner does not exercise joint control over KNT and KHT. KNT refers to Article 1(3) of the Annex to Recommendation 96/280/EC, whereby companies that are to be considered independent are those which are not owned as to 25 % or more of the capital or the voting rights by one enterprise, or jointly by several enterprises, falling outside the definition of an SME. According to KNT, the word \"jointly\" implies joint exercise of control, which is why the enterprises with one or more holdings must pursue a common interest. Although Fritz Klausner, according to KNT, holds shares in KNT and KHT, he has no possibility in corporate law to make decisions regarding the business operations of KHT.\\n(51) KNT furthermore argued that there are no joint economic interests and no economic integration of KNT and KHT. The concepts of the two enterprises are different, being based on different geographical and logistical features and different raw material and sales market conditions. For example, the mill in Wismar is located in an international Baltic Sea port and imports Nordic timber for the production of high-grade sawn timber. The production from Wismar is exported solely by the economically advantageous sea route. In contrast, given its geographical location, the mill in Thuringia has less favourable marketing options. It processes mainly German timber and distributes its lower-grade production to a neighbouring area because of high transport costs. Therefore, there is no close cooperation between the two enterprises, which also do not pursue any common economic interest. KNT and KHT do not, it is argued, have joint management or joint departments for administrative tasks. They also have different suppliers and buyers. Apart from certain product groups, the two enterprises did not compete with each other.\\n(52) KNT added that the independence of KNT and KHT is evident from the current websites of the two enterprises. The link between the websites of KNT and KHT was made to establish a timber cluster via which independent timber processors and suppliers were to be presented. Other companies were to be added, but the project failed. No other link existed between KNT and KHT. Finally, the fact that KHT appears in the aid applications as a contact person for KNT is because Fritz Klausner was the manager of KHT until mid-1997. Today the enterprises have nothing whatsoever in common administratively.\\n4. COMMENTS FROM GERMANY\\n(53) By letter of 2 August 2001, Germany commented on the decision to initiate the procedure. Firstly, it turned to the credit guarantee of DEM 29,75 million assumed by the Federal Government and the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania by virtue of the decision of 6 April 1999. According to Germany, this guarantee served to finance the second saw line on condition that the investment cost increase for the first saw line be secured through an obligation on the part of the lending banks before the credits could be disbursed. The guarantee was a condition for the realisation of the investments and the related positive effects for the region. By letter of 11 November 1998, the Commission agreed that an aid intensity of 0,5 % should be set with respect to guarantees for sound enterprises. The legality and compatibility of the guarantee derived from the Commission decision approving the Federal Government\\'s guarantee programme.\\n(54) Germany replied as follows to the Commission\\'s questions set out in the information injunction. The Commission had requested copies of all the resolutions adopted at the general meetings of KHT and KNT partners since their formation. Germany informed the Commission that no written documents on the KHT partner resolutions existed. Regarding KNT, Germany presented a resolution of 7 April 1999 concerning a capital increase and a resolution of 28 December 2000 on the acceptance of a general partner in KNT GmbH & Co. KG. It also attached a copy of the agreements between KNT or KHT and three of their respective suppliers. These were not always the largest suppliers. No agreement existed between KNT and KHT, on the one hand, and the suppliers, on the other, because KNT and KHT were independent companies. A list of all persons with management duties was presented for KHT but not for KNT.\\n(55) Germany likewise discussed the comments of interested parties. Concerning access to the annual reports of KNT and KHT, it pointed out that no legal reporting requirement exists for limited partnerships with limited liability companies as general partners (GmbH & Co. KG) in accordance with Section 264a of the German Commercial Code. Concerning the equity share in the project financing, it stated that KNT\\'s equity capital amounted to DEM [...]. Finally, it pointed out that the projects in Wismar met the conditions of the joint Federal Government/Länder scheme for regional economic development, under which it is necessary to strengthen the infrastructure and competitiveness of the region via investment. KNT was also having to contend with the difficulties stemming from mounting competition on the timber market.\\n(56) With respect to the annual reports, the Commission notes that, in fact, no reporting requirement existed under German law until 31 December 1999. Regarding the equity contribution, the Commission notes that such an obligation first existed in Germany as of 1 January 2000.\\n5. ASSESSMENT\\n(57) On the basis of the information provided by Germany, the Commission distinguished between two aid packages for KNT, one for the construction of the sawmill in Wismar and the other for its extension.\\n(58) The aid granted to KNT in 1997/98 for the construction of a sawmill in Wismar with a total gross aid intensity of 42,79 % was allegedly granted under regional aid schemes previously approved by the Commission(17).\\n(59) Regarding the aid granted in the period 1998 to 2000 for the extension of the sawmill in Wismar, it is evident from the latest set of documents sent to the Commission by Germany that the total amount of aid corresponded to an aid intensity of 33,99 %.\\n(60) Pursuant to Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts competition or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is incompatible with the common market in so far as it affects trade between Member States. The aid for KNT was granted through State resources. It distorts or threatens to distort competition because it was granted to an individual undertaking in a branch of production and thus conferred on it an advantage over its competitors. Trade between Member States is affected in so far as KNT is active in a branch characterised by such trade. Germany has not disputed the fact that the measures constitute aid.\\n(61) The Commission notes that the measures were implemented in structurally weak areas under Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty. It also notes that the maximum admissible gross aid intensity in these regions was 35 % and 50 % for large enterprises and SMEs respectively on the basis of the relevant schemes and the list of development areas applicable at the time the aid was granted(18). These rates represent ceilings which apply to the total aid granted if, for example, aid is granted under various regional schemes or from local, regional, national or Community resources.\\n(62) In light of the total aid intensity of the first aid package, the aid granted to KNT for the construction of the sawmill required that the aid recipient ranked as an SME within the meaning of the Community SME guidelines and Recommendation 96/280/EC.\\n(63) At the time that Decision 2002/468/EC was adopted, the total aid for the extension of the sawmill in Wismar was not fully known to the Commission even after institution of the formal procedure together with its information injunction. At the time, the total aid intensity of the second aid package obviously exceeded 35 %. This means that the aid recipient had to satisfy the SME definition given in Recommendation 96/280/EC and in the Community SME guidelines applicable at the time.\\n5.1. The SME status of the aid recipient\\n5.1.1. Definition of an SME\\n(64) Under Recommendation 96/280/EC, \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" are enterprises which have fewer than 250 employees and either an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 40 million or an annual balance-sheet total not exceeding EUR 27 million and which conform to the criterion of independence.\\n(65) \"Independent enterprises\" are enterprises which are not owned as to 25 % or more of the capital or the voting rights by one enterprise, or jointly by several enterprises, falling outside the definition of an SME or a small enterprise.\\n(66) In this connection, the Commission recalls its position on SMEs, which consists in providing this category of enterprises with special incentives and removing certain handicaps. Point 1.2 of the Community SME guidelines explains that one of the main such handicaps is the difficulty in obtaining capital and credit as well as access to information, particularly information concerning new technologies and potential markets, and the higher costs entailed by new regulatory arrangements.\\n(67) The bonus (i.e. the increase in the admissible amount of aid) for SMEs is therefore justified not only by the contribution which these enterprises make to the common good but also, in light of their positive role, by the necessary compensation for the handicaps they face. It must be ensured, however, that the bonus is, in fact, granted only to enterprises which have to contend with these handicaps. In particular, the definition of an SME must be so restrictive that only those enterprises which have the envisaged positive effect on third parties and are disadvantaged by the abovementioned handicaps are covered. The definition cannot, therefore, be extended to many larger companies which do not necessarily have a positive effect on third parties or which do not absolutely have to reckon with the handicaps typically faced by SMEs. Aid granted to such companies could lead to further distortions of competition and intra-Community trade.\\n(68) This principle is stated in the recital 22 of Recommendation 96/280/EC, which reads as follows:\"Whereas, therefore, fairly strict criteria must be laid down for defining SMEs if the measures aimed at them are genuinely to benefit the enterprises for which size represents a handicap.\"\\nThe Commission takes particular care to ensure that the independence criterion is not circumvented. In order to guarantee that only genuine SMEs benefit from a scheme, legal constructs of SMEs which constitute economic groupings with greater market power than that of an SME must be excluded.\\n5.1.2. Size of the relevant enterprise\\n(69) Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty relies on the definition of an undertaking when defining an aid recipient. As the Court of Justice confirmed(19), an undertaking need not constitute a separate legal entity but may consist of a group of companies. For purposes of implementing Community law, undertakings must be equated with \"economic units\". Consequently, it is necessary to distinguish between various factors, such as companies\\' shareholding patterns, the persons of the shareholders/partners and the degree of economic integration.\\n(70) The legal person benefiting from the two aid packages is KNT. When initiating the procedure, the Commission stated that there were indications that KNT was not to be regarded as the relevant enterprise. Various elements suggested that the aid recipient was possibly larger than the legal person KNT and might encompass other companies related to Fritz Klausner.\\n(71) Of the enterprises in which Fritz Klausner is present, three companies operate sawmills, namely KHI, KNT and KHT. The sawmill operations of KHI were discontinued in 1996, however. It must be investigated whether KNT itself constitutes a \"single economic unit\" or whether the two other sawmills KNT and KHT can be regarded as companies which together form a single economic unit.\\n- In terms of ownership relations\\n(72) Fritz Klausner possesses the entire capital of KNT and is also the sole shareholder in KNT-GmbH, the general partner of KNT. He therefore decides both on the normal and the extraordinary business transactions of KNT.\\n(73) Fritz Klausner owns all the shares in KHT-GmbH, the general partner of KHT. He owns only 20 % of the capital of KHT-KG. The other limited partner of KHT is KHI. Fritz Klausner owns 75 % of the capital of KHI, although he has not been entitled to vote at general meetings of partners since 1 January 1997. According to Germany, the management authority at KHT-GmbH has been restricted so that KHT-GmbH must now muster three quarters of the voting rights of KHT\\'s partners. Fritz Klausner cannot therefore decide alone on the normal and extraordinary business transactions of KHT but requires the approval of his mother, Margarethe Klausner.\\n(74) The Commission notes, however, that all persons with shares in KHT-GmbH, KHT, KHI-GmbH and KHI belong to the same family.\\n(75) Further elements mentioned by the Commission when it instituted the procedure point to the fact that KNT and KHT have coordinated their activity.\\n- In terms of economic integration\\n(76) When initiating the procedure, the Commission presented the arguments deployed by Germany to prove that KNT and KHT should be considered as different economic units.\\n(77) According to Germany, KNT and KHT have different business concepts based on their geographical and logistical features. The two companies do not pursue the same interests and do not work together.\\n(78) The KNT sawmill is located in Wismar, a Baltic Sea port of international importance. It processes high-quality timber from the best regions in northern Europe. It obtains this high-quality timber with its small knots primarily from Scandinavia, Russia and the Baltic States. It exports its production by sea to the Netherlands, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Denmark, North Africa and Japan.\\n(79) The KHT sawmill is located in Friesau in the low mountain region of eastern Germany. It obtains its raw material from within a radius of 200 km, processing mainly German timber. This timber is of low quality and, because of high transport costs (rail and road), the mill\\'s markets are limited to Germany, Italy and the USA.\\n(80) In addition, according to Germany, the two companies have their own management and personnel departments.\\n(81) When it instituted the procedure, the Commission specified several elements which suggested that the activities of KNT and KHT-KG are coordinated.\\n(82) At the time the procedure was initiated, there was a link on the KNT website(20) to that of KHT; the names of both companies appeared under the heading \"Plant locations\". They were described as being located in central Europe, from where they supplied customers all over the world. Both companies were described as enterprises producing high-quality wood whose customers came from the wood processing industry.\\n(83) For the rest, in contrast to Germany\\'s statements, the two companies appeared to share certain management activities. According to the presentation on the websites, they had a joint sales manager, Anne Leibold, and a joint manager responsible for purchasing, Matthias Wittkemper. For such major business activities as material procurement and marketing, KNT and KHT therefore had the same manager and so appeared to the outside world as a single enterprise.\\n(84) Finally, KHT represented KNT in certain business tasks. The decisions of the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania concerning the granting of investment aid to KNT for the construction of the sawmill were communicated to KNT \"for the attention of\" KHT.\\n(85) Germany did not comment specifically on any of these points. It merely presented a list of KNT and KHT managers which showed that the companies did not have joint management. It also provided the Commission with the agreements of KNT and KHT with three of their suppliers. Germany did not comment, however, on the specific questions raised.\\n(86) KNT reacted to these specific questions, as summarised in recitals 48 to 51. It stated that the two companies pursued different economic interests and did not share any management tasks.\\n(87) The Commission is still of the opinion that sufficient elements indicate some coordination of activities by KNT and KHT. After the procedure had been initiated, the websites of the companies were reorganised. KNT argues that the link which existed at the time was set up in connection with the formation of a timber cluster via which various independent producers and suppliers from the timber industry would be able to present their business activities. Following the failure of the project, the link between KNT and KHT was removed. The Commission notes, however, that on both KNT\\'s and KHT\\'s website the two companies were described as the two plant locations. Both were moreover described as companies which supplied their customers with high-quality sawn timber in Europe and worldwide. The comments by interested parties confirmed that both KNT and KHT are present in central Europe, in the Nordic countries and on all markets on which Nordic and Austrian sawmill enterprises are active. KNT and KHT obviously do not have any clearly separate procurement and supplier markets. Even if such a division existed, the fact that each location is specialised in a specific market segment does not rule out the possibility that they belong to the same economic unit.\\n(88) Regarding the management positions in the two companies, their websites were changed so that the names of Anne Leibold and Matthias Wittkemper still appear only on the KHT management list. They were removed from the KNT list on the companies\\' websites. Anne Leibold as sales manager and Matthias Wittkemper as purchasing manager do not appear on the overview of KNT management personnel which was presented by Germany for the period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1999, but only on that of KHT. This change was not justified to the Commission, which doubts that these changes can be sufficiently justified. It cannot therefore be concluded that KNT and KHT do not carry out joint management tasks.\\n(89) It is evident from the comments by interested parties that KNT and KHT are perceived as one and the same enterprise and as one of the market\\'s largest participants.\\n(90) For the above reasons, the Commission has concluded that the legal person KNT cannot alone be regarded as the aid recipient. On the basis of the information available to it, it concludes that the relevant enterprise is larger and also encompasses KHT. KHT and KNT are actually linked to each other through one of their partners. They pursue the same economic activity; purchasing and marketing are carried out by the same managers; and the two enterprises appear on their respective websites under the heading \"Plant locations\".\\n5.2. Compatibility of the total amount of aid for the construction of the sawmill in Wismar\\n(91) When the procedure was initiated, the Commission had already come to the conclusion that there was no reason to institute proceedings in respect of the investment grant of DEM 43818000 (EUR 22403787,65), the investment allowance of DEM 2635086 (EUR 1347298) and the guarantee with an aid intensity of 0,5 % that had been made available for the construction of the mill in Wismar, which could be regarded as aid that had been granted previously.\\n(92) However, the Commission had doubts regarding the conformity of the investment allowance of DEM 2,5 million. This measure involved aid in the form of a tax benefit which is granted automatically if the legal conditions (i.e. the realisation of the investment) are met. The State does not have any discretion when granting this tax benefit; the decision of the tax authorities does not create a subjective right but merely constitutes an act to determine whether the conditions for a claim exist. Therefore, the moment an investment is realised is to be regarded as the date on which the benefit is granted. In the present case, 1998 is to be considered the year in which this measure was granted since it was granted for investments realised in that year.\\n(93) The Investment Allowance Law provides for a tax exemption for the acquisition and production of capital goods and buildings by enterprises in the new Länder. It defines those eligible for an allowance as economically and organisationally separate operating units. In the present case, KNT is the sole beneficiary of the aid within the meaning of the Investment Allowance Law. In 1998 KNT had fewer than 250 employees and was thus eligible for an investment allowance of 10 %. The investment allowance amounting to DEM 2,5 million (EUR 1278229,70) was, therefore, covered by an approved aid scheme and constitutes existing aid on condition that the cumulation rules are complied with.\\n(94) The Commission must ascertain whether the aggregate aid intensity is admissible and does not exceed the ceiling for regional aid. In 1998 the aggregate aid intensity for the project was 42,79 %.\\n(95) Recommendation 96/280/EC stipulates:\"Where, at the final balance-sheet date, an enterprise exceeds or falls below the employee thresholds or financial ceilings, this is to result in its acquiring or losing the status of \\'SME\\' only if the phenomenon is repeated over two consecutive financial years.\"\\n(96) The reference year to be considered is 1997 since this is the year of the last annual balance-sheet date. Although the aid recipient had 167 employees in 1997, it achieved a balance-sheet total of EUR [...] and turnover of EUR [...], exceeding the thresholds for the definition of an SME. However, this was not repeated over two consecutive financial years as the SME thresholds were not exceeded in 1996, when the aid recipient had 159 employees and a balance-sheet total of EUR [...].\\n(97) Accordingly, the recipient did not forgo its SME status in 1998 and was still an SME in that year, when the aid was granted. The establishment aid granted is thus compatible with the ceiling for regional aid. Other aid was granted under approved schemes and is existing aid.\\n5.3. Compatibility of the total amount of aid for the extension of the sawmill\\n(98) When the procedure was initiated, the Commission had already come to the conclusion that the investment grant of DEM 8879000 (EUR 4539760) for the extension of the project was existing aid. The procedure was thus initiated in respect of the other measures involved in the extension project.\\n(99) The low-interest loan of DEM 8549999,60 (EUR 4371545,98) with an aid intensity of 0,14 % was granted in 1999. Together with the aid already granted for the same project, the aid intensity of all the aid granted for the extension project amounts to 14,55 % of the eligible costs, i.e. below the ceiling of 35 % for large enterprises on the basis of the list of regional development areas. Irrespective of the size of the recipient, the low-interest loan is thus covered by an approved aid scheme and is to be regarded as existing aid on condition that the rules on aid cumulation are complied with.\\n(100) The loan of DEM 6949999,99 (EUR 3553478,57) granted under the KfW environmental programme with an aid element of DEM 186971,46 (EUR 95597) was also granted in 1999. Its aid intensity amounts to 0,3 % of the eligible costs. The low-interest loan has to be regarded as existing aid provided that the rules on aid cumulation are complied with since the aggregate intensity at that time was below 35 %.\\n(101) The investment allowance of DEM 7775095 (EUR 3965117,11) is regarded as aid granted in 1999 since the corresponding investment took place in that year. Its aid intensity amounts to 12,58 % of the eligible costs. The investment allowance has to be regarded as existing aid on condition that the rules on aid cumulation are complied with.\\n(102) The 80 % guarantee for aid of DEM 51000 (EUR 26075,89) was granted in 1999. It has an aid intensity of 0,08 % of the eligible costs. It has to be regarded as existing aid on condition that the rules on aid cumulation are met.\\n(103) The investment allowance of DEM 3385492 (EUR 1730974,57) was granted in 2000 since the corresponding investment was carried out that year. Its aid intensity is 5,5 % of the eligible costs. It has to be regarded as existing aid on condition that the rules on aid cumulation are complied with.\\n(104) The total aid intensity of the measures granted for the extension project amounts to 33,05 %. Consequently, irrespective of the size of the recipient, all the measures are compatible with the rules on cumulation. Moreover, the amount contributed by the aid recipient accounts for at least 25 % of the finance for the productive investments, as required by point 4.2 of the guidelines on national regional aid(21) with effect from 1 January 2000, when Germany implemented the appropriate measures proposed by the Commission. This was confirmed by Germany in its letter of 26 September 2002. The Commission has, therefore, come to the conclusion that the aid for the extension project constitutes existing aid.\\n6. CONCLUSION\\n(105) With Decision 2002/468/EC, the Commission misinterpreted the Investment Allowance Law. It has, therefore, decided to withdraw that Decision, which is based on a clear mistake in law. Moreover, after the Decision had been adopted, Germany provided new information on the aid granted for the investment project. On the basis of that information and the attached documents, the Commission has come to the conclusion that the aid granted to KNT in respect of the construction and extension projects is covered by existing schemes and thus constitutes existing aid,\\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\\nArticle 1\\nDecision 2002/468/EC is herewith withdrawn.\\nArticle 2\\nThe following aid which Germany has implemented for Klausner Nordic Timber GmbH & Co constitutes existing aid:\\n(a) the investment allowance of DEM 2500000 (EUR 1278229,70) for the construction of the Wismar plant;\\n(b) the low-interest loan of DEM 6949999,60 (EUR 3553478,52) granted under the KFW environmental programme for the extension of the Wismar plant;\\n(c) the investment allowance of DEM 7775095 (EUR 3975342,95) for the extension of the Wismar plant;\\n(d) the 80 % guarantee to secure a loan of DEM 12750000 (EUR 6518971,49) for the extension of the Wismar plant;\\n(e) the investment allowance of DEM 3385492 (EUR 1730974,57) for the extension of the Wismar plant.\\nArticle 3\\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.\\nDone at Brussels, 23 December 2002.',\n",

THE FACTS\\nThe relevant products\\n(1) The products which are the subject of this Decision are hydrogen peroxide and its derivatives sodium perborate and persulphates. Together with other products which are not the subject of this decision (organic and inorganic peroxides), these collectively form the \"peroxygen\" sector. Hydrogen peroxide, the basic product, is a powerful oxidant and besides its important captive use (for the production of sodium perborate and other derivatives) it is used in the paper, textile and chemical industries as a bleach and for the treatment of waste. Sodium perborate, the principal downstream product, is used as a bleaching agent in synthetic detergents and washing powders. Persulphates are inorganic compounds used primarily as polymerization initiators in the plastics industry.\\nThe parties\\n(2) The undertakings which participated in the agreements and/or concerted practices concerned in the present decision are: - Solvay et Cie, Brussels (Solvay),\\n- Laporte Industries (Holdings) PLC, London (Laporte), (1) OJ No 13, 21.2.1962, p. 204/62. (2) OJ No 127, 20.8.1963, p. 2268/63.\\n- Degussa AG, Frankfurt (Degussa),\\n- L\\'Air Liquide SA, Paris (L\\'Air Liquide),\\n- Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann (now Atochem), Paris (PCUK).\\nThe worldwide interests of Solvay and Laporte in the peroxygen sector have since 1970 been coordinated and grouped in a series of jointly-owned companies under the name Interox.\\n(3) There is however no holding company, board of directors or chief executive for the Interox activities. Overall policy is determined by a Committee drawn equally from senior directors of Solvay and Laporte which has no formal powers of management or control. Liaison between the various Interox companies on marketing, financial and technical matters is effected by a staff known as Interox Co-Ordination and based in the parent companies\\' offices in London and Brussels. At a day-to-day level the production and marketing activities of each Interox company in the various Member States are carried out by the appropriate Solvay or Laporte subsidiary, the Interox companies in the EEC generally having no working staff but paying for the services of employees of the parent companies.\\nIn October 1983 PCUK was split up and its peroxygen business transferred to Atochem, part of the Elf-Aquitaine group.\\nL\\'Air Liquide and Atochem operate joint hydrogen peroxide production facilities (Oxysynthese) but produce sodium perborate independently and have separate sales departments for both products.\\nMarkets and prices\\n(a) HYDROGEN PEROXIDE\\n(4) The market in the EEC and elsewhere is characterized by the particularly small number of producers.\\nThe total third-party market (i.e. excluding captive use and sales to other producers) for hydrogen peroxide in the EEC is around 90 000 tonnes (worth some 75 million ECU in 1981).\\nThe Interox grouping holds over half this market, Degussa is in second place with ... % (1) and the two French producers each account for some ... %.\\nIn Western Europe the only other producers are Montedison, Eka-Bohus (Sweden) and Foret (Spain). The only other producers of any appreciable scale outside Europe are in the United States and Japan, and imports to the Community are minimal.\\n(5) Prices for the product vary widely not only between the Member States but also inside each national market according to the sector of utilization : inside the same Member State the price paid by the smallest customers can be up to four times that charged to major users.\\nThe chemical industry, which orders in bulk, tends to pay the lowest prices overall and can negotiate large discounts off list price. Inside each national market there is a very broad price spread with some large chemical customers paying only 40 % of the price paid by other large users. Moreover, price levels in one Member State can be up to twice those applicable in another : the average price in France is generally only half the level prevailing in neighbouring countries.\\nDetails of prices obtained by the Commission show (for instance) that in the first quarter of 1982 the spread of prices for the five largest chemical customers in the United Kingdom was 915 to 1435 ECU per tonne, and in France, 354 to 737 ECU.\\nIn the paper and textile industries there are a large number of customers often with only small annual offtakes and prices are higher than in the chemical sector. The same phenomenon of substantial differences in average prices between Member States and wide price variations among individual customers is also apparent in these sectors.\\nThe product is homogeneous and all the major producers in Europe employ the same process route (the \"AO\" or auto-oxydation process) so that there is no great difference in their cost structures. (1) In the published version of the Decision, some figures have hereinafter been omitted, pursuant to the provisions of Article 21 of Regulation No 17 concerning non-disclosure of business secrets.\\nIt is significant that in an internal Interox memorandum the product is described as \"effectively a commodity product (0,5 m tpa) ... (selling) at specialty prices and markups\" with a \"dauntingly high entrance fee in development costs for would-be producers\". Figures obtained by the Commission show gross profit margins in hydrogen peroxide of typically ... % of sales value.\\n(b) SODIUM PERBORATE\\n(6) Western Europe accounts for the major part of world production and consumption of sodium perborate. Again the total number of manufacturers in the EEC is small : besides the hydrogen peroxide producers, which all have downstream production of sodium perborate, only two other chemical concerns manufacture the product and are dependent on bought-in feedstock.\\nThe total EEC market in 1981 was around 450 000 tonnes (value 225 million ECU) of which the Interox grouping had ... % Degussa ... % and the French producers ... % each.\\nCustomers are relatively few in number and consist mainly of the multinational detergent and washing powder producers. Consequently price variations, though not insignificant, are less marked than in the case of hydrogen peroxide.\\n(c) PERSULPHATES\\n(7) In the EEC persulphates market the main producer is the Interox company Peroxid-Chemie. Other EEC producers are Degussa and L\\'Air Liquide. Interox holds about two-thirds of the total market which is around 12 000 tonnes per annum.\\nPosition of EEC producers\\n(8) The European producers between them account for some three-quarters of world hydrogen peroxide output if their overseas operations are included : the Interox grouping, Degussa and Oxysynthese are respectively the three largest world producers of hydrogen peroxide.\\nIn sodium perborate the Western European producers account for some 80 % of world production, and the Interox group is again the world\\'s largest producer.\\nThe European producers between them account for about half the world output of persulphates.\\nSummary of the infringements\\n(9) The investigations carried out by the Commission under Article 14 (3) of Regulation No 17 on 9 and 10 December 1980 and subsequent enquiries under Article 11 of the Regulation showed that: (a) from at least 1961 the above-named producers have conducted their commercial operations in hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate in the EEC on the basis of an agreement or understanding that each national market was to be reserved for those producers which manufacture inside the territory in question (the \"home market rule\");\\n(b) on the basis of an agreement originally made in 1958 by which the market share of Solvay in France for both hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate was to rise to and then remain at one-third of the total national market, the Solvay/Laporte Interox group, L\\'Air Liquide and PCUK divided the French market between them in equal shares;\\n(c) on the basis of an agreement in writing made in or about 1969 between Solvay and Degussa, the business of major customers for hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate in the Benelux was allocated between Degussa and the Solvay/Laporte Interox group in agreed proportions and percentage quotas were fixed for the remaining business (\"Benelux agreement\");\\n(d) on the basis of an agreement in writing made in or about 1970 the market for hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate in Germany was divided between Degussa and the Solvay/Laporte Interox group in the respective proportions of 62 : 38 for hydrogen peroxide and 72 : 28 for sodium perborate and continuous contact took place to ensure that list prices were being respected (\"Germany agreement\");\\n(e) on the basis of an agreement made in 1973 the Solvay/Laporte Interox group and Degussa maintained their world-wide sales of persulphates in the agreed proportion of 70 : 30 and coordinated their pricing policy (\"Persulphates agreement\").\\nDetails of the arrangements made by the parties to which the Commission takes objection are set out in the paragraphs which follow.\\nA. THE HOME MARKET RULE\\nParticipants : Solvay, Laporte, Degussa, L\\'Air Liquide, PCUK (now Atochem)\\nSeparation of national markets\\n(10) The EEC markets for both hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate are strictly divided on national lines. Each producer limits its sales to end-users in those Member States where it possesses production facilities.\\nThus in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, the Interox group and Degussa are at the same time the only producers and the only suppliers of hydrogen peroxide. L\\'Air Liquide and Atochem (formerly PCUK) which manufacture in France only (Oxysynthese) do not sell any hydrogen peroxide whatever in these territories.\\nIn France, Interox, L\\'Air Liquide and Atochem, but not Degussa, operate hydrogen peroxide production plant. The market is equally divided between the first three but Degussa has never sold in France.\\nIn the United Kingdom the Laporte side of Interox is the only producer and enjoys a 100 % monopoly of supply.\\nThe strict separation of the national markets and the absence of intra-Community exchanges is all the more remarkable given the very considerable price differences, particularly as between France and the neighbouring Member States.\\n(11) A similar market division is apparent in sodium perborate, the only difference being that Degussa, while concentrating on the Benelux and German markets where it owns production facilities, does supply some minor customers with small quantities (less than 1 % of the market) in France, Italy and the United Kingdom.\\nThere is also evidence that Interox at least discourages trading across national borders by its customers. Traders in Belgium selling to the German market in 1975 and 1980 were required to cease this activity. The producers also have arrangements of long standing to limit imports of hydrogen peroxide into the EEC particularly from Austria where Alpine is the local producer. This small hydrogen peroxide manufacturer is required to declare to the major producers its EEC sales. It is supposed to limit sales to Belgium to 200 tonnes per annum. When sales by Alpine to France exceeded the \"forecast\" it had given the other producers of 70 tonnes per month this resulted in complaints from L\\'Air Liquide. Interox appears to have believed that this activity could be controlled by an approach to Alpine through Degussa.\\nThe \"home market principle\"\\n(12) Documentation found at Solvay shows that as early as 1961 the producers accepted the principle of respect for \"home markets\" as the basis for the organization of the European market.\\nIn 1959 the major producers had formed an association known as \"Bitop\" (Bureau International Technique de l\\'Eau Oxygénée et du Perborate de Soude). This body was supposedly concerned only with technical matters of common interest but it is apparent that it was considered the appropriate forum for reaching agreement on the division of the market between the producers. When Solvay planned in 1961 to expand outside its traditional \"home markets\" of Belgium and the Netherlands by setting up new factories in France, Germany and Italy, the established producers in those territories wanted to be \"compensated\" for accepting Solvay\\'s presence. At the time Bitop was planning an export quota system for hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate - to include \"exports\" inside the EEC - and the proposal was made to compensate the producers who would have to make room for Solvay on their \"home markets\" by giving them an increased share in the export cartel. Those producers who would not be affected by Solvay\\'s plans - i.e. those located in Austria, Switzerland and the United Kingdom - would give up a third of their exports outside their \"home markets\" to those producers which were concerned by Solvay.\\n(13) At the foundation of the adjusted export quota system, but independent of it, lay the principle of respect for home markets. The export quota system was thus described \"accessory to a geographical sharing (home markets)\" (accessoire d\\'une répartition géographique (home markets)). The same document continues : \"The protection of home markets is applicable in all common market countries.\" (\"La protection des home-markets vaut pour tous les pays du marché commun\"). It is apparent that there were only limited exceptions to the rule : the Austrian producer Alpine had been allocated a small quota for delivery to other European markets. The document observes : \"The Bitop proposal assumes that the home market rule is applied strictly on the Belgian H202 market. However by virtue of a bilateral arrangement between Solvay and Alpine, the latter retains a certain right to deliver in Belgium (200 t telles quelles)\".\\nThe whole tenor of the documentation is that there already existed a consensus of opinion between the producers that the European market was to be organized on the basis of the protection of home markets.\\n(14) In its reply to a request for information under Article 11 of Regulation No 17, Solvay described the home market rule as \"the old principle whereby it makes good sense for each producer to supply the major part of its output in the country where it produces ... this \"rule\" existed well before Solvay made its entry into the business independently of the agreements to share export markets\". In their replies to the statement of objections however both Solvay and Laporte deny that Solvay had thereby impliedly admitted the existence of any understanding to this effect between the producers.\\n(15) A sodium perborate export cartel was set up in 1962 but no details of how the quotas were calculated are available. In the same year Bitrop changed its name to \"CIPP\" (Centre d\\'Information de Peroxydes d\\'Hydrogène et de Perborate de Soude).\\nWhile the manufacturers claim as far as the organization of markets was concerned that CIPP was involved only with quotas to non-EEC countries it is apparent that the \"home market principle\" continued to govern their relations with each other in the European market which accounted for 90 % of their business. In 1968 Degussa (which had hitherto manufactured only in Germany) planned to expand by building a new plant in Antwerp. Solvay\\'s reaction to this proposed expansions was to boycott CIPP for 18 months : it clearly considered that Degussa was trespassing on its territory. Their differences were resolved with the conclusion of agreements on the division of both the Benelux and German markets in 1969/70 and Solvay returned to CIPP. In a memorandum of 23 March 1970 a Laporte executive observed : \"The home market principle emerged through this period more or less unscathed\". In a further comment it is made clear that the rôle of CIPP was not confined to third markets : \"it should be borne in mind that the observable activities of CIPP at plenary sessions, both formal and informal, are a very small part of actual achievements. The arguments surrounding and the heat generated on third markets is (sic) no more than a safety valve, tending to disguise the fact that they probably account for a mere 10 % of turnover and even less in terms of profitability\". The implication is that the more serious work of CIPP concerned the stability and organization of the European market.\\n(16) The abolition of CIPP was already mooted in the memorandum which concluded by observing that as only three producers of any importance were left in Europe - Solvay/Laporte, Degussa, and L\\'Air Liquide/PCUK - \"there may therefore be scope for advocating the abolition of CIPP and the formation of a smaller but possibly more powerful arrangement consisting of the three producers\".\\nCIPP was indeed dissolved in 1972 but collaboration between the three major groups continued. An ad hoc committee met to administer quotas in third markets but there was also collusion on tendering for capital projects. Generally these would involve the construction of a turnkey plant in a non-EEC country to be operated under licence by a local producer or a joint company. An internal Laporte minute (of unknown date) reads : \"Meet in Paris to discuss common terms. Greece. We should withdraw. Degussa will not offer. Check with the French.\" On the one known occasion when an opportunity arose inside the EEC for a new capital project (for a major chemical producer in Germany in 1979) Degussa expected the \"home market\" rule to apply and when told by Laporte that the French producers had been approached said it would like the French to \"protect\" i.e. quote a deliberately uncompetitive price to allow Degussa as local producer to obtain the business. (The actual tenders submitted are difficult to compare but in the event the project was abandoned).\\n(17) A Laporte memorandum dated 18 April 1979 of a meeting with Degussa indicates that the major groups at that time still had a precise understanding on how the European market was to be divided between them and in which countries each was to supply. (The memorandum was headed \"Strictly confidential - do not file\" and marked \"RED\" in capital letters across the first page. The term \"red note\" was apparently used in Laporte to denote documents relating to market sharing agreements which were to be kept secret.) Degussa was planning to abandon production of the hydrogen peroxide substitute sodium peroxide, a product in which it had a monopoly in the EEC. It supplied customers not only in the Benelux and Germany but also in other countries such as France and the United Kingdom. Giving up production would mean that these customers would be in the market for an equivalent quantity of hydrogen peroxide. It is significant that the basic assumption on both sides was not that the producers would compete for the new business, or even that Degussa would in future supply its sodium peroxide customers with hydrogen peroxide, but that the business would normally fall to be divided up in each market in accordance with a pre-existing formula. Thus Degussa would be totally excluded from the United Kingdom and from France, where Interox would gain 100 % and 33 % respectively of the new business. It is significant that the Interox \"normal gain\" in Germany and France corresponded with the quotas it had been given under the original market sharing agreements for those countries. Degussa wanted however to have half of all the new business in hydrogen peroxide that would arise, and it is apparent that both parties anticipated that without much difficulty the other producers (particularly the French) could be persuaded to give up some of the benefit they would have gained \"as a reward for the Interox initiative\". It is also significant that Europe is divided into Germany on one hand and \"Interox\" markets on the other, and those where other producers are present are referred to as \"those markets where there is sharing\", and the producers are described as \"partners\". The assumption that in the United Kingdom Interox\\'s \"normal gain\" would be 100 % of the business indicates that it was accepted by the producers that this market was normally reserved for Laporte. Again it is significant that Degussa, while eager to take part of any increased quota in the United Kingdom, assured Laporte that such supplies would be \"fully controllable\".\\n(18) Laporte and Solvay claim the proposal was never implemented. Whether it was or not is irrelevant : the significance of the proposals is the underlying assumption that any new business would in the normal course of events have to be divided so as to maintain the status quo on each market.\\nThe arguments of the producers\\n(19) The producers all deny that there exists or existed a general understanding or arrangement between them regarding the division of the EEC market according to a \"home market\" principle.\\nThey all contend that the rigidity of the pattens of trade and the confinement by each producer of its sales to particular markets is accounted for not by any agreement or understanding to that effect but by natural market forces. The establishment of the EEC (it is said) has not served to overcome invisible barriers to trade such as the desire of customers for security of supply, their preference for local suppliers, currency fluctuations and transport problems and costs.\\n(20) It is argued by Solvay that on the demand side the market division results as far as Interox is concerned from the geographical location of its production units and for the other producers from a variety of factors including production capacities and technical problems of transport. Solvay goes on to contend that the rules of competition do not compel a producer to follow an active policy of trade between Member States : restriction of sales to home markets is only unlawful if it results from collusion which, it is argued, has not been proved. The phenomenon observed by the Commission is said to be the natural result of the oligopoly in hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate : in such a market there is a natural tendency for prices to stabilize which involves a corresponding equilibrium in market shares.\\nUnless they enter into a counter-productive price war which will benefit no-one, the producers are thus - according to Solvay - obliged to accept such an equilibrium in the market. Nevertheless for its part Solvay says it adopted at specific moments a policy of attacking particular markets by installing new capacity : such was the case in 1956 when it expanded to France, Germany and Italy. The same situation arose at the end of the 1960\\'s when Degussa set up its Antwerp plant. In order to achieve market penetration producers are obliged to set up plant in the market concerned which will give the other producers reason to fear a real \"war\" unless they make room for the new arrival.\\n(21) Degussa also recognizes that a \"home market\" principle exists but claims it results not from collusion but from the independent commercial judgement of the producers in an oligopolistic market. The reason why the French producers did not enter the German market was fear of retaliation from Degussa in France. With regard to its own expansion to the Benelux in 1970 it did so without any prior arrangement with Solvay. Degussa however had assumed that no retaliation would occur because the main customer for its new plant was to be Henkel, its oldest client, to which Solvay could not object.\\n(22) Laporte admits that the use of the terms \"home market rule\" or \"home market principle\" was not confined to the documents found by the Commission nor indeed that they were unknown outside Solvay and Laporte. However it argues that the specific references to the \"home market rule\" are not inconsistent with the operation of natural market forces and says that the Commission has placed \"undue weight\" on the documents and the prejudicial circumstances of their discovery.\\nFactual conclusions\\n(23) The Commission does not accept that the strict market separation on national lines which is a characteristic of both the hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate sectors in the EEC results from natural market forces or the independent commercial judgment of the producers.\\nIt considers that the market separation is the result of an arrangement or understanding of long duration (from at least 1961) between the producers, originally based on an acceptance of the \"home market principle\", i.e. that the national markets would be reserved for domestic producers. Where a producer did expand by installing or planning to instal production facilities in a national market previously not within its sphere of operations (as Degussa did in 1968 to 1970) this would be regarded as a disloyal or hostile action : hence Solvay\\'s boycott of CIPP for 18 months. Nevertheless the difference between the two groups concerned was resolved by the conclusion of a detailed market-sharing quota agreement between them on the division of the Benelux market and the maintenance of the status quo in Germany ; hence the remark that the principle had emerged \"more or less unscathed\". There was also an agreement for sharing the French market equally between three producers. The Commission does not consider that these bilateral agreements were isolated or discrete arrangements : they formed part of a wider organization of the market based on the allocation of territories to each producer. The whole rationale of these agreements is that the available market is divided between certain producers and they would not have been practicable unless the participants had the certainty that their arrangements on the division of the business, the allocation of customers and on pricing would not be disturbed by incursions from other producers.\\nThe \"red note\" of 18 April 1979 shows not only that there were close contacts between Degussa, Interox and the French producers but also that the EEC market was the subject of a detailed understanding on how business was to divided between the producers. This document, together with the earlier references in 1961 and 1970 provides the necessary evidence of collusion between the producers on the organization of the European market.\\n(24) The opportunity for monitoring the maintenance of the agreed market divisions was provided for in Bitop, then in CIPP, and latterly in the ad hoc contacts between the producers. These meetings were clearly not concerned only with technical matters or even the export quotas for third markets as is made clear from the withdrawal of Solvay in protest at Degussa\\'s Benelux expansion and the observations made by Laporte on their activities.\\nThe expression \"home market rule\" or \"home market principle\" was used by the producers themselves in relation to the partitioning of the market and is not the creation of the Commission. Contrary to the argument of Laporte, it does not consider that it should overlook or ignore the implications of the documentation found at the premises of the producers and expressly referring to such a principle.\\nWhile it is correct that hydrogen peroxide (but not sodium perborate) requires special care in handling and shipping, such transport problems do not - as the manufacturers claimed - prevent the product from being supplied across national frontiers. Degussa for instance supplies a considerable part of the German market from its Antwerp site, while certain concentrations sold in France by Interox are produced in Belgium. Even the English Channel is not a great obstacle, as is demonstrated by Degussa\\'s expressed readiness to take part of any increased quota in the United Kingdom.\\n(25) The Commission therefore considers that the evidence shows: (i) the major part of the EEC market is partitioned on strict national lines with each producer supplying only in those territories where it has production facilities;\\n(ii) this market division results from and is referable to an understanding or arrangement between the producers;\\n(iii) the various market-sharing agreements (for Germany, the Benelux and France) are not isolated or fragmented cases but constitute part of a general cartel formed by the producers by which the market is organized.\\nB. MARKET SHARING AGREEMENT IN FRANCE\\nParticipants : Solvay, Laporte, L\\'Air Liquide, PCUK (now Atochem)\\nThe 1958 agency agreement\\n(26) In or about 1958 Solvay constructed a new plant for hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate at Tavaux in France. At the same time the two French producers formed their joint subsidiary Oxysynthese to produce hydrogen peroxide.\\nBy an agreement in writing made in 1958 (and reproduced in its essential terms by a second agreement in 1967) Solvay appointed the two French producers as agents for the sale and distribution of its peroxygen products in France. The contract provided that at the beginning of each year the parties would determine by mutual agreement the tonnage of each product to be sold on Solvay\\'s behalf.\\nThe producers however admit that at the same time the contract was signed the producers agreed that each producer would cover one-third of the French market in hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate. The arrangement continued after the setting up of Interox in 1970 and regular meetings were held to review the market situation and supervise the administration of the quotas.\\n(27) In 1973 the chemical producer Rhône-Poulenc constructed a new hydroquinone plant at St-Fons with an annual requirement of several thousand tonnes of hydrogen peroxide. Solvay (Interox) claimed that the market-sharing agreement entitled it to a one-third share of this new business but the French producers demurred and concluded a total requirements contract with Rhône-Poulanc for this new application. The three producers never reached agreement on the question of the division of the Rhône-Poulenc business. The St-Fons factory takes all its requirement from the French producers (± 5 000 tpa).\\nAt the beginning of the 1970\\'s Solvay was setting up its own sales network in France and becoming less dependent on the agency arrangements. This agreement was terminated by notice to end on 1 January 1975 and from that date Interox made its own arrangements for the sale and marketing of peroxygen products in France.\\nContinuation of the market-sharing arrangements\\n(28) While the agency agreement was terminated according to the legal requirements the quota agreement was never formally cancelled and the participants have produced no documentation to show that it was brought to an end.\\nSolvay claims that the quota arrangements lapsed at the same time as the agency agreement. The evidence obtained however shows that not only did the quota arrangements continue to produce their effects - in the sense that the agreed division of the market into three was maintained - but also that this was referable to a continuing collusion between the three producers.\\nMaintenance of the agreed market division\\n(29) The one-third market share allocated to Solvay for France has been maintained since the termination of the agency agreement in 1975. The Rhône-Poulenc requirement had not been contemplated by the parties when the original market share had been agreed and it is apparent from the documentation that it was treated as a new application quite separate from the general hydrogen peroxide market. Solvay appears to have tacitly accepted that Rhône-Poulenc St-Fons should be treated as a special case.\\nExcluding St-Fons, the average market shares of the three producers in hydrogen peroxide in France between 1975 and 1980 were in the proportion AL 32,3 % ; PCUK 33,3 % ; Interox 34,4 %. The French hydrogen peroxide market in 1980 (excluding Rhône-Poulenc St-Fons) was some 15 000 tonnes.\\nIn sodium perborate as well the same division into three almost equal parts also remained : over the same five years the average was AL 32 % ; PCUK 34 % ; Interox 34 %. The market in 1980 was estimated at 83 000 tonnes.\\nExchange of information on deliveries\\n(30) The three producers which supplied the French market continued after 1975 to exchange detailed information on their respective production and sales figures of the same kind as they had done previously. Now however it was effected every month through a body known as the \"Chambre Syndicale de l\\'Eau Oxygénée et des Persels\". This body collects statistics from each of the producers and issues them with composite figures for the whole French market. The limited number of producers (effectively only two in hydrogen peroxide) means that each producer is automatically informed of the production and sales of the other group and can also check that its own market share remains at approximately one-third of the total.\\nIn fact, besides the monthly statistics issued by the \"Chambre Syndicale\" the producers exchanged further and more detailed information on matters not covered by the \"official\" exchange. The data available through the Chambre Syndicale do not include details of sales to individual customers, nor can these be discovered by any analysis of the figures. The producers also deny exchanging any information other than via the \"official\" association. Nevertheless documentation obtained from Solvay for 1978 to 1981 shows that it was precisely and correctly informed of the sales made by L\\'Air Liquide, PCUK and Oxysynthese to individual customers.\\n(31) Thus Solvay knew exactly to the tonne the quantity of hydrogen peroxide supplied in 1978, 1979 and 1980 by the producers to the two major chemical industry customers as well as the exact quantities sold by Oxysynthese to Rhône-Poulenc for the hydroquinone plant at St-Fons. On this basis it was able to check its market share in each of the principal sectors (paper ; chemical industry excluding Rhône-Poulenc hydroquinone ; textiles). For 1979 and 1980 it was also aware of the precise tonnage supplied by the French producers to each customer in the chemical and the paper sectors, including those which were not its own customers (which indicates that it must have obtained the information from PCUK and/or L\\'Air Liquide). These documents also confirm that the producers treat Rhône-Poulenc\\'s St-Fons requirement for hydroquinone as a special case.\\n(32) Similarly Solvay knew the exact sales of sodium perborate by the French producers to each of the four main detergent producers for 1978, 1979 and 1980, and could check that it had roughly one-third of the business of each ; although the breakdown by customers is not apparent from the composite monthly figures from the Chambre Syndicale.\\nThe Commission has under Article 11 of Regulation No 17 checked the sales of each producer to the major individual customers and the figures obtained confirm the accuracy of those recorded by Solvay : they were not therefore simply estimates but constituted correct information which could only have been obtained from the other suppliers.\\nFrom 1981, that is, following the investigations made by the Commission in December 1980, the documents no longer showed any information on individual customers.\\nArguments of the producers\\n(33) The producers all deny that the agreement dividing the market into thirds survived the termination of the agency agreement in 1975. They point to the variations from year to year in the relative percentage market shares of the three suppliers and claim that these are inconsistent with a system of fixed quotas. It is also argued that in relation to hydrogen peroxide it is illogical to exclude the supplies to Rhône-Poulenc St-Fons and that if these were included Interox would only have around 25 % of the market.\\n(34) They also argue that there is no evidence of collusion : the exchange via the \"Chambre Syndicale\" was not intended (they say) to provide a check on the maintenance of the three-part market division. Solvay claims that the documents showing detailed knowledge to the last tonne of the quantities supplied to each major customer - which cannot be discovered from the official \"Chambre Syndicale\" statistics - are not conclusive proof of any exchange of additional information. While the other producers can provide no explanation of how this information came into Solvay\\'s possession Solvay claims that it could have come from customers who have an interest in communicating their annual requirement to a potential supplier. It provided the Commission with reports of visits to customers which it claimed supported its contention.\\nFactual conclusions\\n(35) The Commission considers that the arrangement to divide the French hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate market equally between the three suppliers was independent of the formal agency agreement which was terminated in 1975 and continued in practice until at least the date of the Commission\\'s investigations in December 1980.\\nAlthough it is correct that the shares of the producers relative to one another fluctuated, their average market shares for both products during the six years in which the Commission considers the sharing arrangement to have remained in force was almost exactly one-third each, the division which had originally been agreed. The argument that there is no reason for excluding Rhône-Poulenc St-Fons from the general third-party hydrogen peroxide market for France is disproved by the parties\\' own documentation : it is apparent that it is treated as a special case. In any event the argument does not apply to the sodium perborate sector where the equal sharing is also apparent.\\n(36) The exchange of information went far beyond the official \"Chambre Syndicale\" scheme which even on its own permits the market behaviour and market share of individual producers to be identified. The detail and accuracy of the total sales made to individual customers by the French producers shown in the Interox documents is such that it could only have been ascertained by contact between the suppliers themselves. The Commission does not accept that such detailed and accurate information on competitors\\' sales was obtained from consumers. The visit reports supplied by Solvay to support its argument that it may have obtained these details from customers generally do not even relate to the customers of whose consumption it was informed in precise detail and even where they do concern a customer listed in the documents give only general estimates of monthly or annual requirements which do not correspond with the precise figure as set out in the tables on which the Commission relies. The Commission concludes that the producers systematically exchanged details of their sales to each major customer. By exchanging detailed figures each producer could not only check that its market share was being maintained at one-third but could also ascertain the source of any imbalance or deviation.\\nC. BENELUX AGREEMENT\\nParticipants : Solvay, Laporte, Degussa\\n(37) To accommodate the new production capacity of Degussa in Antwerp which was due to come on stream in 1970, an agreement was reached at the end of 1969 between Solvay and Degussa on the division of business and the allocation of major customers in both hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.\\nDegussa\\'s plans had originally been resisted by Solvay which had reacted by boycotting CIPP meetings for 18 months.\\nIn hydrogen peroxide, the Netherlands market was to be divided equally between the two producers. For Belgium, special arrangements were made for the business of the two major customers : UCB was allocated to Solvay and AKZO was to be shared equally between them. As regards the rest of the Belgian market Degussa was to be permitted to build up its share progressively to one-third.\\nIn sodium perborate the Benelux was treated as a single unit to be divided between Solvay and Degussa in the proportion of 80 : 20, with the exception of Henkel, Degussa\\'s oldest customer, where the proportions of the share were to be reversed (i.e. Degussa was to get 80 %).\\n(38) These arrangements were summarized in writing in the form of so-called \"gentleman\\'s agreements\" which were still in existence and were being referred to in secret internal memoranda as late as April 1979. In spite of repeated requests made to both parties during the investigation and subsequently no copies have ever been provided to the Commission and it has had to rely on the account given in response to requests under Article 11 by Laporte.\\nAfter Solvay and Laporte set up the Interox grouping the arrangement was continued. Meetings were held three times each year to review the operation in practice of the agreements and to correct deviations from the quotas. Imbalances would be corrected by the producer whose market share was below quota reducing his selling prices or offering special terms in order to increase his sales in the next quarter. There was also some telephone communication between the producers to ensure the agreement was being kept. Over the years the original agreement was subject to some modification and practices developed which had not been envisaged at the outset. Nevertheless as Solvay admits the parties met regularly until at least the end of 1980 and had reached a consensus on their respective positions in the market.\\n(39) In 1978 a proposal was made (apparently by Degussa) to \"simplify\" the Benelux agreement (and the \"Germany\" agreement) and reduce contact to a minimum. There was however no intention on either side of altering the status quo as outlined in the agreements. The essential key to any successful simplification of the agreements was said to be the willingness of individuals \"at the highest level\" to exert their influence on the national managements to ensure that quotas were rigorously adhered to, with any deviations to be the subject of criticism. The plan, which was agreed in a meeting between Degussa and Interox on 17 April 1979 for submission to more senior company officials would involve central management informing the national managements (incorrectly) that any detailed arrangements which may have existed between the two groups were being revoked but that \"common sense\" would prevail in the future. Contact was to be reduced to a minimum and was to take place only through certain named executives on each side.\\nSolvay, and Laporte claim the proposal to \"simplify\" the agreements was never implemented : if that is so, the arrangements must have continued as before.\\nSolvay, Laporte and Degussa admit their participation in the Benelux agreement until December 1980.\\nD. GERMANY AGREEMENT\\nParticipants : Solvay, Laporte, Degussa\\n(40) A related but separate agreement was reached in 1970 between Degussa and representatives from Solvay and Laporte on the division of the German market. The purpose of this agreement, which was also made in writing, was to maintain the \"status quo\" based on the respective average sales of the two groupings in Germany over the preceding three years in both hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.\\nThis gave the Interox grouping 38 % of the market in hydrogen peroxide to Degussa\\'s 62 %. For sodium perborate the agreed percentage quotas were 28 to 72 %. The size of the market for these products in Germany in 1980 was respectively 23 000 and 130 000 tonnes. Copies of this agreement were provided to the various national managements but again the parties declined to provide copies.\\nMeetings took place three or four times each year to supervise the detailed execution of the quota agreement. In one document dating from 1974 and found at Solvay the \"Soll\" (or quota) of the two producers is calculated to two decimal places : 38,64 % : 61,36 %. This document also indicates that particular arrangements, not disclosed by the producers, were made in respect of the division of the business of the major customers AKZO, Ciba Geigy and Henkel : the note of the 1979 Degussa-Interox meeting also indicates that special quotas had been set for different customers.\\nIt is not clear in what detail the original agreement covered the fixing of prices. In practice the two groups were in telephone contact several times each week to ensure that their list prices - which were identical - were being respected.\\n(41) In 1979 the parties were also anxious to simplify the \"Germany\" agreement which involved a far closer degree of contact - and hence a greater risk of discovery - than the Benelux agreement. It was agreed in principle that in future there should be less concern to check prices at individual customers provided there was no risk to maintaining the basic price structure. The quota arrangements for different customers or in different sectors were also to be simplified in such a way that the status quo was not disturbed. On price, if either side wished to apply below-list prices for a new application, the initial contact was to be made via Interox-coordination (i.e. Solvay or Laporte head office). These points were to be summarized in a draft annex to be attached to the original Germany agreement. Again it is claimed the proposed amendments were never implemented.\\nThe parties have also admitted their participation in the Germany agreement until December 1980.\\nThe claim however in relation to both the Germany and Benelux agreements that they were intended only to facilitate the maintenance of an \"equilibrium\" already existing in fact by reason of the oligopolistic structure of the market.\\nE. PERSULPHATES AGREEMENT\\nParticipants : Solvay, Laporte. Degussa\\n(42) In 1979, following anti-trust proceedings in the United States in the persulphates sector, involving among others Solvay and Laporte, the Commission carried out an investigation into the possible extension of the alleged arrangements on the United States market to the EEC. The representatives of Laporte denied categorically that there had ever been any restrictive agreements concerning the European market and the enquiry was closed.\\nThe evidence obtained during investigations in the present case shows however that in or about 1974 the Interox grouping and Degussa agreed to fix their respective sales of persulphates on the world market (including the EEC) in the proportion of 70 : 30 based on their respective sales in the period 1971 to 1973.\\nArrangements were also made between Peroxid-Chemie (the Interox company primarily concerned with persulphates) and Degussa to share the new business which arose when the Dutch producer AKZO ceased production in 1977.\\nTotal sales figures were periodically exchanged and steps taken to redress any imbalance in the quotas. The collaboration in the persulphates field also extended to discussions on the coordination of pricing policy.\\nII. LEGAL ASSESSMENT\\nA. ARTICLE 85 OF THE EEC TREATY\\nArticle 85 (1)\\n(43) Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty prohibits as incompatible with the common market all agreements between undertakings or concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market, and in particular those which: (a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;\\n(b) limit or control production, markets, technical development or investment;\\n(c) share markets or sources of supply;\\n(d) ...\\n(e) ...\\nAgreements and concerted practices\\nThe general cartel : home market rule\\n(44) The Commission does not consider that the strict separation of the EEC market and the confinement by each producer of its activities to certain markets arose from natural market forces or the independent judgment of the producers. The documentation which was found for 1961 made frequent reference to a \"home market rule\" which, as Solvay stated, already existed and was distinct from any accessory agreement on third market quotas. The evidence shows that the \"home market rule\" was accepted by the producers on the basis of reciprocal cooperation on which the industry was organized. The \"home market principle\" was again mentioned in 1970, being said to have \"emerged more or less unscathed\" from the period of differences between Solvay and Degussa, which were resolved with the conclusion of status quo and quota agreements in Germany and the Benelux. The 1979 document (\"red note\") shows that the close collaboration between the producers and a reciprocated community of interest continued at that time with the division of the EEC market forming the basis of a general consensus between all the producers.\\n(45) It is not necessary, for the establishment of a concerted practice, for the parties to have agreed a precise or detailed plan in advance. (Judgment of the Court of Justice in Re the European Sugar Cartel : Suiker Unie and Others v. Commission, Cases 40-48/73 ; 50/73 ; 54-56/73 ; 111/73 ; 113-114/73 Judgment of 16 December 1975 (1), paragraphs 173 to 174.) The criteria of coordination and cooperation laid down in the case law of the Court must be understood in the light of the concept inherent in the provisions of the Treaty relating to competition that each economic operator must determine independently the policy which he intends to adopt on the common market. This requirement of independence does not deprive undertakings of the right to adapt themselves intelligently to the existing and anticipated conduct of their competitors, but it does strictly preclude any direct or indirect contact between them, the object or effect of which is either to influence the conduct on the market of an actual or potential competitor or to disclose to such a competitor the course of conduct which they themselves have decided to adopt or contemplate adopting on the market.\\nThe documents show that the decision by each producer of its markets and customers was not the subject of independent commercial judgment. The \"home market rule\" is expressly and consistently mentioned as the basis on which they conducted their activities first in \"BITOP\" and then in \"CIPP\". The 1979 \"red note\" of the Degussa-Interox meeting shows that there was close contact, direct and indirect, between all the producers on their future conduct and plans as well as a general consensus on how any new business was to be divided between them on each national market.\\n(46) In the present case the evidence shows that: (a) the producers accepted and intended that their commercial conduct in the EEC should be governed by the principle of protection of traditional home markets, (1) ECR 1975, p. 1663. the restriction by each producer of sales to those territories where it possessed production facilities, and the division of business in those markets where several producers were present according to specific market sharing agreements;\\n(b) in accordance with this rule they confined their activities to particular defined markets;\\n(c) as a result the division of the EEC market on national lines was maintained.\\nThe Commission therefore considers that the factual separation of national markets in the major part of the EEC results from and is referable, if not to an agreement properly so called, at least to a concerted practice between Solvay, Laporte (acting as Interox), Degussa, L\\'Air Liquide and PCUK (now Atochem).\\nThe Germany, Benelux and Persulphates agreements\\n(47) The particular arrangements concluded in 1969/70 between Degussa and the Solvay-Laporte Interox grouping setting up market sharing quotas and collusion on pricing for hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate in Germany and the Benelux, as well as the 1974 \"Persulphates\" agreement covering the whole world including the EEC, constitute \"agreements\" for the purposes of Article 85. The market division and the conduct of the producer groupings formed the subject of precise and detailed agreements between the parties which were reduced to writing and formed the basis for their market behaviour in those sectors.\\nMarket sharing agreement in France\\n(48) The original division of the French market in hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate by which each producer took a one-third share constituted an \"agreement\" in terms of Article 85.\\nThe Commission considers that, contrary to the submission of the producers, the convergent behaviour of the parties and the maintenance after 1974 of their respective market shares in the proportion originally agreed resulted from their continuing to act in collusion.\\nThe mutual disclosure by the three producers of business details on their deliveries to major customers not only through the \"official\" information exchange but also by further contacts must have been intended enable each to check that the agreed market division was maintained. This arrangement indicates that the producers were still united by an express or implied agreement to divide the market. The continuation of the agreed market division was therefore the result of an agreement or at least a concerted practice.\\nUndertakings\\n(49) For the purpose of the present proceedings the Commission does not consider the Interox grouping as an undertaking possessing an identity sufficiently distinct from that of its two parent companies so as to absolve Solvay and Laporte themselves (as opposed to Interox) from liability under EEC competition rules. The Interox operation is simply the framework in which the activities of Solvay and Laporte in the peroxygen sector are coordinated and profits shared and all major policy decisions are taken by the parent companies. The Interox companies do not determine their market behaviour autonomously but in essentials follow directives issued by the parent companies.\\nThe Commission in its statement of objections has expressly reserved the right to examine in future proceedings the applicability of Article 85 of the Treaty to the Interox arrangements. Solvay and Laporte contend that Interox is a separate undertaking constituting a merger falling outside Article 85 (1), but for the purpose of these proceedings have accepted that the parent companies are liable for any infringements referable to the Interox operation.\\nThe fact that L\\'Air Liquide and PCUK operated a joint manufacturing facility for hydrogen peroxide (Oxysynthese) does not affect their separate identity as undertakings.\\nAt all relevant times, the other French supplier besides L\\'Air Liquide was PCUK, part of the Pechiney-Ugine-Kuhlmann conglomerate. In 1983 the French chemical industry was reorganized and the peroxygen business of PCUK was transferred to Atochem part of the Elf-Aquitaine group. The Commission considers that as the present owner of the business entity which was involved in the infringements, and having taken over the assets and adopted the economic objectives of PCUK in this sector, Atochem must be the addressee of any decision and responsible for the payment of any fines imposed in respect of the infringements committed by PCUK.\\nThis decision is therefore addressed to Solvay, Laporte, Degussa, L\\'Air Liquide and Atochem.\\nRestriction upon competition\\n(50) The overall market division and sharing arrangement, and the individual agreements covering particular geographical areas and products, together regulate almost all trade in the products concerned in a major part of the common market, and involved all the principal producers in the European market for a major industrial sector.\\nThe \"home market\" arrangement, enunciated in 1961 and later refined to accommodate Degussa\\'s expansion plans to the Benelux in 1970, delineated the territories in which each producer was to supply and consolidated the established positions of those producers to the detriment of effective freedom of movement in the common market.\\nAs regards the individual agreements (Benelux, Germany, France, \"Persulphates\") these were intended to, and did, eliminate all effective competition between the parties on the markets and in the products concerned.\\nThe argument made by the parties that the structure of the market, the position of the producers and the nature of the producers are such that conditions of competition would have been no different if they had not had the agreements, is irrelevant. Article 85 applies just as well to oligopolistic markets as to more fragmented markets. The very fact that the parties considered it necessary to enter into agreements which either maintained the status quo or limited the market penetration of a particular supplier to a given percentage, shows that market conditions might well have been different had the free play of competition been permitted.\\nEffect upon trade between Member States\\n(51) The complex of arrangements made on a European (and world) level between the major producers of peroxygen products had the effect of excluding virtually all trade between Member States except through channels subject to control by restrictive agreement. The \"home market\" rule involved producers refraining from supplying on the territory of others or confining their activities to particular markets where restrictive market sharing agreements had been made. The only movement of products between Member States thus occurred in the context of the agreed market organization or as coproducer deliveries.\\nThe restrictive arrangements on the different national markets were designed to implement and reinforce the general market division between the producers and cannot be separated therefrom. However, even if they are considered individually, the market sharing arrangements for the Benelux, Germany and France have an appreciable effect upon trade between Member States.\\nThe Benelux agreement covers trade in three Member States. In the case of the other arrangements, the agreements by dividing each national market between two or three producers effectively contribute to the preservation of barriers to trade. Further, both Degussa and the Interox grouping are established in several Member States and product supplied on one national market under the terms of a market sharing arrangement may well have been produced in another Member State : for example, Interox supplies certain products in France from its factory in Belgium.\\nThe persulphates agreement fixed the respectives shares of the two major producers in the whole of the EEC and by its very nature affected trade between Member States.\\nConclusion\\n(52) The Commission therefore considers that: (a) the agreement or concerted practice between all the producers by which the EEC market was organized on the basis of the respect of home markets and the confinement by producers of their sales to particular territories;\\n(b) the agreement dating from 1958 by which the French market in hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate was to be equally divided between Solvay (later Interox), L\\'Air Liquide and PCUK;\\n(c) the \"Benelux\" agreement of 1969 by which the respective shares of Solvay (later Interox) and Degussa in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg for hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate were fixed according to agreed quotas;\\n(d) the \"Germany\" agreement of 1970 by which the respective shares of Degussa and the Interox grouping in the German hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate markets were fixed on the basis of the status quo and continuous contact took place to ensure list prices were respected:\\n(e) the \"Persulphates\" agreement of 1974 by which the respective shares of Degussa and Interox in the EEC persulphates market were fixed and their price policy coordinated;\\nconstituted infringements of Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty.\\nArticle 85 (3)\\n(53) Under Article 85 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission may on the fulfilment of certain conditions grant undertakings an exemption from the prohibition of Article 85 (1). In order for the Commission to consider any exemption, however, it is a necessary pre-requisite that the agreements or concerted practices in question be notified in proper form, which was not the case in the present proceedings.\\nEven if the agreements or concerted practices had been properly notified there would be no possibility of any exemption being granted. Market sharing and price fixing arrangements of the type under consideration in an important industrial sector where there are a limited number of producers, virtually all of which are involved, are fundamentally contrary to the basic objectives of the Treaty. The agreements cannot be said to improve the production or distribution of goods, and their result is to eliminate any possibility of effective competition in respect of the products in question. Any benefit that could be said to result from the agreements (i.e. stability of market shares and high prices) accrue only to the participants.\\nB. REGULATION No 17\\nFines\\n(54) The Commission may, by Article 15 of Regulation No 17, impose fines of from 1 000 to 1 000 000 ECU, or a sum in excess thereof not exceeding 10 % of the turnover in the preceding business year of each of the undertakings participating in the infringement where either intentionally or negligently, they infringe Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty. In fixing the fine, regard shall be had to both the gravity and the duration of the infringement.\\nIn the present case the only view the Commission can take of the agreements and concerted practices is that they are of extreme gravity and were of long duration.\\nThe gravity of the infringements lies in the fact that over a long period the producers of hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate and persulphates effectively eliminated all possibility of effective competition in a market worth several hundred million ECU annually, and would no doubt have continued their secret arrangements indefinitely but for the discovery of the relevant evidence by the Commission.\\nThe division of markets on national lines and the series of market sharing and quota agreements together constituted a cartel which jeopardized inter-State trade in a way which is contrary to one of the fundamental objectives of the EEC Treaty, namely the creation of a single market between the Member States.\\nThe cartel involved deliberate and wide-ranging infringements of EEC competition law and was persisted in even after the Commission had carried out investigations concerning the persulphates sector in 1979 under Article 14 (2).\\n(55) As regards duration, the \"home market\" arrangement dated from almost the very establishment of the common market while in the case of the individual agreements these ran from 1958 for France, from 1969/70 for the Benelux and Germany, and from 1974 in persulphates.\\nIn so far as the \"home market\" arrangement and the French market-sharing agreement were already in effect before Regulation No 17 came into force on 6 February 1962, the Commission will assess fines only in respect of their operation after that date. While the home market agreement was in operation from 1961, the Commission considers that for the purposes of Article 15 of Regulation No 17, its most serious aspects were manifested from about 1970 onwards with the formation of Interox, the concentration of the producers effectively into only three major groupings, and the arrangements made to accommodate Degussa\\'s expansion to the Benelux.\\nThe parties claim that the infringements admitted were terminated immediately after the Commission\\'s investigations in December 1980. Although there is no substantive evidence that this was in fact the case, the Commission will assess any fines on the assumption that the infringements were not continued after this date.\\n(56) In assessing fines however, some distinction can be drawn between the respective responsibility of Solvay, Laporte and Degussa on the one hand and the French producers on the other. The Solvay-Laporte Interox grouping and Degussa are the major world producers of the products in question and played a dominant role in the conception and operation of the cartel. Degussa is the second largest world producer and was involved in the detailed agreements for the Benelux and Germany : the reason it did not sell in France or the United Kingdom was the \"home market rule\" of which it was a major beneficiary, Germany being the largest individual EEC market.\\n(57) In 1980, the last year in which the cartel was definitely known to have been in operation, the turnover of the Interox grouping in the products concerned in the EEC amounted to some ... million ECU.\\nAlthough after the formation of the Interox grouping Solvay and Laporte as joint owners are both responsible for its activities, the Commission is imposing separate fines. In recognition of the fact that Solvay is the larger of the parent companies of Interox, and the peroxide sector forms a far greater proportion of Laporte\\'s total turnover than of Solvay\\'s, the Commission will make some distinction between them.\\nIt also takes into account that Laporte\\'s responsibility for the French and Benelux agreements dates from 1970 when the Interox grouping was formed, both these agreements having originally been negotiated with the other participants by Solvay.\\nDegussa\\'s EEC turnover for the products concerned in the year ending 30 September 1980 was ... million ECU.\\nThe French producers had a somewhat lesser role which reflects their smaller part of the EEC market compared with Interox and Degussa. While they were not participants in the Benelux or Germany agreements, their confinement of their activities to their domestic market however ensured the effectiveness of the restrictive arrangements on other markets between Interox and Degussa, particularly as regards the maintenance of price differentials between the Member States.\\nIn 1980 their EEC sales of hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate to third parties (excluding co-producers) came to ... million ECU for L\\'Air Liquide and ... million for PCUK.\\nTermination of infringements\\n(58) By Article 3 of Regulation No 17, the Commission may, on finding that there is an infringement of Articles 85 or 86 of the EEC Treaty, require the undertakings concerned to terminate the said infringement.\\nThe Commission is not satisfied that the infringements have in fact ever been terminated. Even where Solvay and Laporte have admitted the existence of specific market-sharing agreements they state that these were not considered \"appropriate for formal termination\". Degussa for its part while admitting that employees \"may have participated\" in such arrangements, denied that its senior management was aware of the existence of the agreements.

The main conditions, for the purposes of the present Decision, were as follows:\\n- Italy was to honour the commitment to complete the restructuring plan by privatising the companies and production sites of Enirisorse and liquidating it completely by 31 December 1998,\\n- the income from privatisation was to be used to cover any further liquidation costs,\\n- the Italian Government was to set up a procedure to monitor the implementation of the Decision.\\nThe first half-yearly report reached the Commission on 11 November 1997. It showed that the sale of Pertusola Sud, one of the remaining companies owned by Enirisorse SpA which manages a zinc-production plant in Crotone, had not yet taken place, contrary to the restructuring plan notified by Italy and approved by the Commission.\\nThe problems surrounding Pertusola Sud had been of major importance in Decision 98/212/EC. At the time, Italy had said that the company would be closed down or sold to an interested buyer by the end of 1997. In the second scenario, the buyer was to convert the production complex from zinc to nickel. These were the terms in which the closure or sale of Pertusola Sud appeared in the restructuring plan for Enirisorse, notified to the Commission and restated in Decision 98/212/EC.\\nGiven that the Enirisorse\\'s operating losses for 1997 were apparently attributable to the activities of Pertusola Sud, the Commission counted on the closure or sale of the company to a private buyer in order to achieve the ultimate aim of the restructuring plan, i.e. the final liquidation of Enirisorse.\\nThe same report revealed that in 1997 ENI had given Enirisorse fresh capital injections amounting to ITL 133 billion. This new capital was used partly to cover the operating costs of Pertusola Sud and the cost of liquidating Enirisorse. The new capital injections were not provided for in the restructuring plan notified to the Commission and therefore were not taken into consideration in Decision 98/212/EC. The new capital injections were not notified to the Commission and were therefore made illegally.\\nThe Commission therefore had to examine these new capital injections as new aid measures, illegal because granted in breach of the prior notification pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty.\\nAs it had on the basis of the information gathered in the first stage of its investigations, the Commission came to the conclusion that the capital injections carried out by ENI in 1997 were unlikely to yield a sufficient financial return, given that Enirisorse would be liquidated very soon. Therefore, it could not be claimed that ENI was acting as a private investor. In any case, Enirisorse had suffered serious losses for over five years; a private investor would have restructured or liquidated the company much sooner, in order to avoid prolonged losses.\\nThe Commission had serious doubts as to the compatibility of the capital injections with the common market, since they did not seem to qualify for the derogations under Article 92(2) and (3) of the Treaty. It therefore decided to initiate the Article 93(2) procedure in respect of the new capital injections.\\nII\\nFollowing publication of the notice on the initiation of the procedure(3) by letter of 6 April 1998 the Government of the United Kingdom submitted its own comments in support of the Commission\\'s arguments. The UK authorities said that, given the financial situation of Enirisorse, the new capital injections made by ENI were inconsistent with the action of a private investor.\\nBy letter of 4 May 1998 the company Union Minière, a zinc producer and direct competitor of Pertusola Sud, submitted its comments, also in support of the Commission\\'s arguments. Union Minière said that the new capital injections given to Enirisorse concerning the financial years 1997 and 1998 intended to cover the losses of its subsidiary Pertusola Sud constituted State aid which was not notified and therefore illegal. The new aid clearly and unduly distorted competition in the market in zinc, already suffering from structural overcapacity.\\nNo other Member State or interested party submitted comments to the Commission. The comments of the United Kingdom and Union Minière were forwarded to the Italian Government by letter of 28 May 1998.\\nIII\\nIn its reply to the letter initiating the procedure and to the abovementioned comments by third parties, the Italian Government challenged both the Commission\\'s Decision to initiate the procedure and the comments by the third parties, in so far as:\\n- the capital injection in question amounting to ITL 133 billion was notified to the Commission as part of the monitoring procedure provided for in Decision 98/212/EC,\\n- of the total ITL 134 billion, ITL 34 billion were intended to cover losses of Pertusola Sud, while the remaining ITL 99 billion served to cover costs relating to Enirisorse. The ITL 99 billion was used to help complete the restructuring plan approved by the Commission; this further injection of ITL 99 billion should be considered as in effect authorised, even though it was not formally included in the aid provided for in the plan, given that the Commission had stipulated, in Article 3(b) of Decision 98/212/EC, that Italy should communicate any further liquidation costs,\\n- the amounts (ITL 99 billion) intended to cover the costs of liquidating and closing down an undertaking cannot possibly distort competition since the recipients are undertakings which are permanently ceasing their activities and leaving the market.\\nWith regard to the ITL 34 billion paid to Pertusola Sud, the Italian Government recognises the fact that Enirisorse gave capital injections totalling ITL 34 billion to Pertusola Sud in 1997 in order to compensate the company\\'s losses. However, it goes on to state that:\\n- when the Commission adopted Decision 98/212/EC, it knew that Pertusola Sud was to lose ITL 48 billion that year. Therefore, by imposing the sale or closure of Pertusola by the end of 1997, the Commission implicitly approved continuation of activities up to that date and the consequent compensation of losses accumulated in 1997,\\n- the Pertusola Sud plant is situated near Crotone in an area which qualifies for regional aid under Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty; the aid in question should therefore be considered compatible with the common market in the light of those Treaty provisions.\\nIV\\nEnirisorse was set up in 1991 as a non-operating holding company, intended to optimise the economic and financial resources of the ENI Group and with the basic objective of entrusting the administration of the Group\\'s holdings, mainly in mining activities, to a single centre of responsibility. In fact, ENI and its shareholder at the time (the Ministry of the Treasury) decided in 1991 to pull out of the non-core business so as to make the core business profitable again by separating it from loss-making activities. The ultimate aim was to privatise the holding company Enirisorse.\\nTo that end, Enirisorse formulated a plan of one-off aid measures including, for the purposes of this Decision, closure of the Pertusola Sud plant by the end of 1997, or sale to an interested buyer who would turn the complex into a production unit for nickel.\\nAt the end of the five-year period 1992 to 1996, Enirisorse had received from its sole shareholder, ENI, capital injections of ITL 1 819 billion for the purpose of implementing the plan. In its Decision 98/212/EC the Commission found that this aid was compatible, subject to the terms and conditions set out in the notified restructuring plan. In the same period, Enirisorse also expected to receive about ITL 840 billion from the sale of companies and areas of business.\\nV\\nWhether the capital injections constitute State aid\\nIn order to assess whether the capital injections totalling ITL 133 billion constitute State aid, the Commission examines the flow of capital between the Italian State, the main shareholder at the time, and Enirisorse in the light of the market economy investor principle as set out in the Commission\\'s communication to the Member States on public undertakings in the manufacturing sector(4). According to this principle, State aid is involved if the financial transaction would not have been undertaken by a private investor operating under normal market economy conditions.\\nAs the time of the events in question, i.e. 1997, alongside the Italian State, which was by far the largest shareholder, other private investors held shares in ENI. Nevertheless the Ministry of the Treasury, which held most of the shares in ENI at the time, played a leading strategic role in determining the Group\\'s business decisions.\\nThe capital injection of ITL 133 billion, the subject of the initiation of the procedure, was financed by proceeds that would otherwise have benefited ENI\\'s shareholders, in particular its controlling shareholder, the Italian State. Consequently, the funds which ENI made available to Enirisorse must be considered State resources within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.\\nThe Commission has good reason to suppose that the capital injections made by ENI totalling ITL 133 billion will yield an insufficient, or rather non-existent financial return, given that the measures consist basically in covering the losses of a company, Pertusola Sud, which should already have been liquidated, and unspecified liquidation costs which the Commission does not see why ENI should undertake, unless it has a specific legal obligation to do so.\\nIf there is no such legal obligation, which it was up to the Italian State to prove, ENI\\'s conduct does not conform to that of a private investor operating under market economy conditions, since it could not count on a profitable return in proportion to the amount of the capital injection, and in fact would have to give up hope of even the smallest return on the investment, given the decision to liquidate Enirisorse in any case by 31 December 1998.\\nIt certainly cannot therefore be claimed that ENI acted as a private investor when it decided to make further, fresh capital injections of ITL 133 billion. A private operator would have liquidated Enirisorse, limiting the liquidation costs as much as possible and taking action only if it had a specific legal obligation to do so. From the evidence at its disposal, the Commission must conclude that ENI did not act in response to a legal obligation connected with the normal procedures for liquidating a company.\\nThe measures in question therefore constitute State aid.\\nVI\\nThe illegality of the State aid\\nAs to the legality of the aid in question, in its reply to the initiation of the procedure the Italian Government maintains that the injection of ITL 133 billion was notified to the Commission as part of the monitoring procedure provided for in Decision 98/212/EC.\\nThe Commission must point out in this regard that the information concerning the new capital injection, one among the many items of information sent to the Commission in the context of the monitoring procedure, should have been notified formally, since this was new aid, not included in the amounts authorised in Decision 98/212/EC. In any case, the Italian authorities did not comply with the obligation to give prior notice before implementing the aid, as stipulated by the Court of Justice, in particular in its judgment in Case 120/73 Lorenz v Germany(5).\\nThe Italian authorities themselves agree that the new injection of ITL 133 billion was not included in the ITL 1819 billion authorised by the Commission. However, they claim that, of the ITL 133 billion, ITL 99 billion was used to help complete the restructuring plan approved by the Commission. The further injection of ITL 99 billion should be considered as in effect authorised, even though it was not formally included in the aid provided for in the plan, given that the Commission had stipulated, in Article 3(b) of Decision 98/212/EC, that Italy should communicate any further liquidation costs.\\nThe Commission cannot accept this argument in so far as Article 2 of Decision 98/212/EC expressly stipulated that the proceeds of privatisation of Enirisorse could not be used by ENI to invest in other companies owned by ENI, but had to be used to defray any further liquidation costs of Enirisorse. This means that, although the Commission might have foreseen further liquidation costs at the time it adopted its Decision, it was clear from the wording of this Article that, as far as the Commission was concerned, any such costs were to be met using revenue from the privatisation of Enirisorse\\'s companies, certainly not using new State aid in the form of fresh capital injections, as was in fact the case.\\nThere is also no basis to the claim by the Italian authorities that the Commission, knowing that Pertusola Sud would lose a further ITL 48 billion in 1997 and having accepted that it would close by 31 December 1997, implicitly authorised the compensation of those losses.\\nThe fact that the Commission was aware that Pertusola Sud was to suffer further losses does not in any way imply that it approved new aid to cover such losses. It was entirely reasonable, as may be seen from Decision 98/212/EC, that Enirisorse should have compensated the losses of Pertusola Sud using revenue from privatisations carried out in the medium term, or at least using the holding company\\'s own internal funds, without having recourse to a new and absolutely unplanned injection of capital, as was in fact the case.\\nThe measures in question therefore constitute illegal State aid in so far as they were not notified by Italy to the Commission before being granted and, a fortiori, were not authorised by the Commission pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty.\\nVII\\nCompatibility of the aid with the common market\\nAs to the compatibility of the aid, the Italian Government maintains first of all that the amounts intended to cover the costs of liquidating and closing down an undertaking cannot possibly distort competition in the common market or affect trade between Member States, since the recipients are undertakings which are permanently ceasing their activities and leaving the market.\\nThis claim has no basis in the present case. It is directly contradicted by the comments of Union Minière, a competitor of Pertusola Sud, which complains that the aid allowed the company to remain active on the zinc market, thus distorting competition with other zinc producers.\\nIn this case, the companies which benefited directly or indirectly from the aid in question are still active on the market, often still producing, as in the case of Portovesme and Pertusola Sud which, although put into liquidation a few months ago, is still an active zinc producer. Without the aid in question it would have had to be sold or closed down some time ago.\\nTherefore, the argument put forward by the Italian authorities cannot be accepted, since the liquidation costs in question have had direct or indirect repercussions on companies still active on the market.\\nItaly also claims that, in any case, the Pertusola Sud plant is situated near Crotone in an area which qualifies for regional aid under Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty. The aid in question should therefore be considered compatible with the common market in the light of those Treaty provisions.\\nThe Commission would point out in this regard that Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty allows the Commission, in derogation from the ban on State aid which affects trade between Member States and distorts competition, to declare as compatible with the common market, \"aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment, where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest\".\\nIn this context the Commission has authorised regional aid, having established the viability of the company involved. In other words, regional aid is authorised in so far as it can effectively bring an advantage to the region, almost always in terms of employment, linked to the viability over time of the undertaking receiving the aid. In any case it is clear, as confirmed by successive Court judgments (see, most recently, the judgment of the Court of First Instance in Joined Cases T-126/96 and T-127/96 EFIM and BFM v Commission(6) that the Commission cannot, even in the context of the application of Article 92(3)(a), waive consideration of the Community interest, i.e. it must never confine itself to verifying the regional specificity of the measures involved without assessing their impact at Community level.\\nIn the case in point, Italy simply invokes a regional derogation for a company in liquidation, with no prospect of any viability even in the medium term. This means that the capital injection can lead to no concrete advantage in terms of employment, since the Italian authorities themselves acknowledge that in any case Pertusola Sud, already in liquidation, will close by 31 December 1998.\\nNor does the measure in question appear to serve any regional policy purpose, since aid to liquidate companies cannot be said to be aimed at \"promoting the economic development\" of an area. It is, in fact, a further measure aimed at keeping Pertusola Sud active on the market at all costs for another few months, with no industrial, economic or regional logic behind it.\\nTherefore, as far as the cited provisions of Article 92(3)(a) are concerned, the Commission must conclude that the ad hoc aid measures in question were not taken as part of a government strategy effectively promoting regional development, such as would qualify for the derogation in question. The case file does not even show that the aid was granted to create jobs in an assisted area. On the contrary, all the evidence suggests that these are ad hoc measures aimed at the industrial survival at all costs of companies still controlled by Enirisorse, and in particular Pertusola Sud.\\nAs to possible compatibility of the new aid under Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, the Commission would stress that this provision was not directly cited by the Italian authorities during the procedure. However, the Commission would repeat that State aid may qualify for this derogation provided that it does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest. As for restructuring aid, the only aid which might possibly be cited in the present case, the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty(7) state that this type of aid is extraordinary and cannot be renewed, unless this is justified by exceptional circumstances. In this case the aid in question, which was new and in addition to the aid already authorised by Decision 98/212/EC, goes against the \"one-off\" condition, since there are no new, exceptional circumstances which might justify authorisation by the Commission.\\nVIII\\nOn the basis of the above considerations, the Commission concludes that the aid in the form of capital injections of ITL 133 billion, questioned in the decision to initiate the procedure, does not qualify for any of the derogations under Article 92(3)(a), (b) or (c) in so far as it is not intended to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or to restructure undertakings which are to be closed down soon and in any case before 31 December 1998.\\nWhen it initiated the procedure, the Commission reminded the Italian authorities that any aid granted illegally is liable to be followed by a Commission decision requiring the Member State in question to recover it, and, in this case, the Commission considers it necessary to recover the aid in order to restore the fair competition which prevailed before it was granted,\\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\\nArticle 1\\nThe State aid granted by Italy in 1997 to Enirisorse SpA in the form of capital injections totalling ITL 133 billion is incompatible with the common market.\\nArticle 2\\n1. Italy shall take all necessary measures to recover from Enirisorse SpA the aid which has already been unlawfully paid.\\n2. Recovery shall be effected in accordance with the procedures of Italian law. The amounts to be recovered shall include interest from the date on which the aid was paid to Enirisorse until the date on which it is effectively recovered. The interest shall be calculated on the basis of the reference rate used to calculate the net grant equivalent of regional aid.\\nArticle 3\\nItaly shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.\\nArticle 4\\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\\nDone at Brussels, 25 November 1998.',\n",

whereas on the basis of Article 5 (2) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 the 1990 financial year began on 16 October 1989 and ended on 15 October 1990;\\nWhereas the Commission has carried out the checks provided for in Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70;\\nWhereas Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1723/72 of 26 July 1972 on making up accounts for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 295/88 (4), provides that the decision to clear the accounts must include the determination of the amount of expenditure incurred in each Member State during the financial year in question recognized as chargeable to the Guarantee Section of the Fund; whereas Article 102 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 (5), as last amended by Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EEC) No 610/90 (6), provides that the outcome of the clearance decision, that is to say, any discrepancy between the total expenditure booked to the accounts for a financial year pursuant to Articles 100 and 101 and the total expenditure recognized by the Commission when clearing the accounts, is to be booked under a single article, as additional expenditure or a reduction in expenditure;\\nWhereas, pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70, only refunds on exports to third countries and intervention to stabilize agricultural markets, respectively granted and undertaken according to Community rules within the framework of the common organization of the agricultural markets, may be financed;

whereas the inquiry subsequently carried out in Irish export firms showed no anomalies with regard to the declaration; whereas, therefore, the amount for Ireland should be charged to the Community; whereas, on the other hand, the inquiries carried out in Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom showed anomalies with regard to the declarations made; whereas definitive financial corrections of Bfrs 22 646 327 for Belgium, Pta 24 002 044 for Spain and £ 51 169 for the United Kingdom should therefore be fixed; whereas the amounts of Bfrs 78 815 823 for Belgium, Pta 602 590 406 for Spain and £ 3 999 860 for the United Kingdom should consequently be charged to the Community budget;\\nWhereas Decision 92/491/EEC fixed, subject to revision, a financial correction of Bfrs 71 307 680 in respect of the basic co-responsibility levy and the additional levy which should have been paid by Belgium in the cereals sector; whereas, however, the Commission undertook to re-examine the disallowance on condition that Belgium provided the evidence requested; whereas scrutiny of the documents provided and the findings of the inspections carried out revealed no information casting doubt on the justification for the financial correction or showing that the situation with regard to checks on collection of the levy had substantially changed; whereas, on the other hand, the correction can be reduced by Bfrs 30 275 887 on the basis of that information; whereas, therefore, this amount should be charged to the Community budget;\\nWhereas Decision 92/491/EEC fixed, subject to revision, financial corrections at DM 4 217 752 for Germany in respect of export refunds for beef and veal and DM 1 609 109 in respect of private storage for beef, at FF 1 500 000 for France in respect of the late payment of part of the minimum price in the context of production aid for peas and field beans, at Lit 1 241 513 490 for Italy in respect of financial compensation for withdrawals of fruit and vegetables and at Esc 80 074 799 for Portugal in respect of financial compensation for withdrawals of fish in the fisheries sector; whereas, however, the Commission undertook to re-examine the disallowances on condition that the Member States provided the evidence requested; whereas, on the basis of the evidence provided by the Member States in question, the abovementioned amounts can be charged to the Community budget;\\nWhereas Commission Decision 92/491/EEC fixed, subject to revision, a financial correction of Dr 120 296 927 for Greece in respect of export refunds granted in the cereals sector in view of the illegal grant of national export subsidies; whereas, however, the Commission undertook to re-examine the disallowance; whereas the additional verifications carried out by the Commission revealed no information casting doubt on the justification for the financial correction;

Commission (1), annulled the accounts clearance decision for 1988 in respect of Greece in so far as it had adopted a financial correction of Dr 245 233 relating to the sale by Greece of beef held in intervention storage; whereas, as a result, and in accordance with Article 176 of the Treaty, the abovementioned amount must be charged in this clearance of accounts to the Community budget for 1988;\\nWhereas, in its judgment of 14 July 1967 in Joined Cases 5, 7 and 13 to 24/66, Kampffmeyer and Others v.

Commission (3), the Court of Justice found that the Commission bore non-contractual liability to make good the damage caused by Decision 63/553/EEC (4), whereby it had authorized Germany to maintain a protective measure in the cereals sector; whereas, in the abovementioned judgments, the court also decided that the amounts to be actually paid to the parties concerned depended on the question of damages and the interest which would be awarded under German law; whereas under national legal procedures Germany fully compensated the parties concerned; whereas, on the basis of the information forwarded by the German Government and in accordance with the joint liability of the German Government and the Commission for the damage caused, the Commission should charge DM 955 721, being half of the amount paid by Germany, to the Community budget;\\nWhereas, in respect of Belgium, the inquiries regarding exceptional market support measures in the pigmeat sector and the processing of butter into butteroil are now closed, as are the inquiries in respect of Italy regarding the quality of durum wheat bought into intervention and inspection of withdrawals of fruit and vegetables, the inquiry in respect of the Netherlands regarding the eligibility of butter bought into intervention between 1982 and 1987 and the inquiries in respect of Ireland and Italy with regard to public storage in the context of intervention in the beef and veal sector; whereas this Decision lays down the further action to be taken with regard to these cases;\\nWhereas Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 provides that the financial consequences arising from irregularities or negligence are not to be borne by the Community if they are the result of irregularities or negligence attributable to administrative authorities or other bodies of the Member States; whereas some of those financial consequences which cannot be borne by the Community budget should be included within the scope of this Decision;\\nWhereas this Decision is without prejudice to any financial consequences which may be determined in any subsequent clearance of accounts in respect of national aid or infringements for which the procedures started under Articles 93 and 169 of the Treaty are now being implemented or were terminated after 30 April 1993;\\nWhereas this Decision is without prejudice to any financial consequences determined by the Commission, during a subsequent accounts clearance procedure from current investigations underway at the time of this Decision, from irregularities within the meaning of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 or from judgments of the Court of Justice in cases now pending and relating to matters covered by this Decision,\\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\\nArticle 1\\nThe Member States' accounts concerning expenditure financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section in respect of 1990 are hereby cleared as indicated in the Annex.\\nArticle 2\\nThe amounts arising under points 3 of the Annex are to be taken into account as part of the expenditure referred to in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2776/88 (1) for the month of November 1993.\\nArticle 3\\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\\nDone at Brussels, 25 November 1993.\",\n",

Such authorisations have to be based on the evaluation of effects on human and animal health and influence on the environment. Elements to be taken into account in such evaluations include operator and bystander exposure and impact on the terrestrial, aquatic and aerial environments, as well as impact on humans and animals through consumption of residues on treated crops.\\n(2)\\nMaximum residue levels (MRLs) reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in terms of estimated dietary intake.\\n(3)\\nMaximum residue levels (MRLs) for pesticides covered by Directive 90/642/EEC are to be kept under review and may be modified to take account of new or changed uses. Information about new or changed uses has been communicated to the Commission with respect to fenbutatin oxide, fenhexamid, cyazofamid, linuron, triadimephon/triadimenol, pymetrozine, and pyraclostrobin.\\n(4)\\nThe lifetime exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (3). Based on those assessment and evaluations, the MRLs for those pesticides should be set so as to ensure that the acceptable daily intake is not exceeded.\\n(5)\\nIn the case of pymetrozine, linuron, triadimenol, pyraclostrobine and fenbutatin oxide for which an acute reference dose (ARfD) exists, the acute exposure of consumers via each of the food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices currently used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. The opinions of the Scientific Committee on Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides (4), have been taken into account. Based on the intake assessment of pymetrozine, linuron, triadimenol, pyraclostrobine and fenbutatin oxide, the MRLs for those five pesticides should be fixed so as to ensure that the ARfD will not be exceeded. In the case of the other substances, an assessment of the available information has shown that no ARfD is required and that therefore a short term assessment is not needed.\\n(6)\\nWhere authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residues in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data, MRLs should be fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination.\\n(7)\\nTherefore it is appropriate to fix new MRLs for those pesticides.\\n(8)\\nThe setting or modification at Community level of provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for fenhexamid, cyazofamid, linuron, pymetrozine, and pyraclostrobin in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto.

THE FACTS\\n(1) This proceeding concerns the agreements, known as 'guidelines', within the Eurocheque Community, relating to the production and finishing of Eurocheques and Eurocheque cards and in particular the selection and prior approval of firms authorized to take part.\\n(2) On 29 June 1984, the Commission received a complaint from SA Arjomari-Prioux under Article 3 of Regulation No 17 concerning, in particular, the agreements and the way they were applied.\\n(3) On 19 July 1984, the Secretary-General of Eurocheque International submitted, on behalf of the national organizations making up the Eurocheque Assembly, a notification and application for negative clearance concerning the guidelines for the production of the uniform Eurocheque, the guidelines for the production of the uniform Eurocheque card and the guidelines for the finishing of the uniform Eurocheque and the uniform Eurocheque card, all these guidelines having been approved by the Eurocheque Assembly at its meetings on 19 and 20 May 1983.\\nFollowing discussions between Eurocheque International and the Commission, the Eurocheque Assembly adopted amended versions of the guidelines which from the subject of this Decision at its session on 4 and 5 June 1987.\\nThe Eurocheque system\\n(4) The Eurocheque organization was created in 1968 on the private initiative of European financial bodies. Its aim is to meet the need for international\\npayment systems resulting from the growth of tourism and business travel within Europe, by making available a means of payment which customers may use both in their country of origin and in other countries.\\n(5) The Eurocheque system is open to all European banks (1) It is based on two instruments: the Eurocheque and the Eurocheque card. The drawee bank guarantees any payee bank reimbursement of a Eurocheque presented with the corresponding card, up to a predetermined maximum amount.\\n(6) Eurocheque International estimates that some 9 000 banks issued 32 milion Eurocheque cards to their customers in 1987 in 20 countries, including all the Member States except Greece.\\nA total of 900 million Eurocheques have been drawn, of which some 46 million were drawn abroad. The customers of many banks which issue Eurocheque cards receive Eurocheques for payments both in their country of residence and when travelling abroad.\\n(7) Some 15 000 banks and other financial institutions cash uniform Eurocheques at their countries in 40 European and Mediterranean countries. Uniform Eurocheques are also accepted in payment by traders in 28 of those countries. Total annual payments by Eurocheque in both the country of residence and abroad represent some ECU 100 000 milion.\\n(8) The agreement concluded on 31 October 1980 within the Eurocheque system on Eurocheques drawn abroad in the local currency was granted an exemption pursuant to Article 85 (3) of the EEC Treaty by Commission Decision 85/77/EEC (2).\\n(9) Within the Eurocheque system, the 'issuing' financial institutions supply their customers with cheques and cards which may be used within the Eurocheque system and cash cheques at their counters, whereas 'accepting' institutions cash guaranteed cheques at their counters made out by customers of 'issuing' banks but do not issue their customers with cards or cheques which may be used within the system.\\n(10) Of the cheques and cards which may be used in the Eurocheque system, approximately 80 % are uniform Eurocheques and cards, the format and technical characteristics of which are defined in the notified agreements.\\nThe Eurocheque Community\\n(11) One of the main objectives of the Eurocheque Community which brings together the issuing institutions, is to encourage credit institutions to issue uniform cheques and cheque cards rather than the other, non-uniform instruments that may be used in the sytem, in order to encourage widespread recognition and acceptance of Eurocheques by traders in a large number of countries.\\n(12) The issuing institutions of each country are grouped together, within the Eurocheque system, in national associations or organizations, to which this Decision is addressed for their information.\\n(13) Member banks undertake to issue the payment instruments as defined in the guidelines.\\n(14) The Eurocheque Assembly ('Assembly') is the decision-making, managing and monitoring body of the Eurocheque Community. Its decisions are binding on all members provided they are not contrary to national laws or regulations. The Assembly appoints a Secretary-General who is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Eurocheque Community (Article 20). He manages the permanent secretariat of the organization in Brussels - Eurocheque International.\\nSecurity in the Eurocheque system\\n(15) Because of the guarantee given by the bank, a Eurocheque accompanied by a Eurocheque card is equivalent to a banknote, with a maximum value currently fixed at the equivalent in local currency of approximately ECU 190, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled when the cheque is made out, e.g. the cheque must correspond to the cheque card.\\n(16) Consequently, the cheque and the card must incorporate certain features and be of uniform quality to protect them from counterfeiting and forgery. As stated in the notification 'the risk inherent in the system is . . . fundamentally tied to the production quality of the payment instruments'.\\nThe manufacturers authorized to participate in the production of Eurocheque instruments must therefore be able to offer a high-quality product. They must also comply with stringent security requirements designed to prevent both the theft of finished or semi-finished products and the equipment or materials used in their production, and the misuse of such equipment.\\n(17) The security measures usually taken to protect the transport of banknotes are also applied to each production stage and to the transport of cheques and cards.\\nThe products\\n(18) The agreements concern the production and finishing of Eurocheques and Eurocheque cards. These processes are made up of several operations: production of the special paper for the cheques and cards, printing, lamination of the cards and incorporation of the technical devices and, lastly, personalization of the cheques and cards.\\n(19) Eurocheque paper belongs to a category of products known as security paper, the chief characteristic of which is to make counterfeiting both difficult and expensive. This can be achieved by several methods, e.g. watermarks, the quality or the 'feel' of the paper itself, or other devices that are difficult to reproduce or imitate. Other security devices can also be incorporated at the manufacturing stage, their main purpose being to make forgery more difficult, e.g. attempts to alter data on documents made from such paper, such as a signature or a figure.\\n(20) Producers of cheques and cheque cards use highly sophisticated printing techniques. Here too, the object is to prevent counterfeiting, e.g. by including extremely detailed and complex patterns in the design, using a wide range of colours and incorporating devices to prevent forgeries.\\nWhilst finishing may involve less sophisticated techniques, the security requirements are identical.\\n(21) In 1983 and 1984, the annual quantity of Eurocheque paper supplied by authorized manufacturers was [ . . . ] (1) tonnes, representing a total value of approximately ECU [ . . . ]. The value of the printed cheques supplied to customers in 1983 was of the order of ECU [ . . . ], to which may be added the value of the 26 million cards issued, estimated at ECU [ . . . ]. Estimates based on the steady increase in the number of Eurocheques and cards issued between 1984 and 1988 indicate a [ . . . ] % increase on the figures given above in the period 1984 to 1988.\\nThe Commission does not have any accurate data on the annual value of finsihing work. This may, however, be estimated, on the basis of the number of cheques used, at ECU [ . . . ], plus a smaller amount for the finishing of cards. The finishing of Eurocheque instruments represented only a very small part of similarly technical work carried out by the printing sector. If one looks at just the work carried out in security conditions similar to these required by the agreements, the market is much larger than simply the finishing of Eurocheque instruments. Firms in this sector are also involved in producing other security documents such as bank cheques, travellers' cheques, identity documents, lottery tickets and securities.\\nThe notified agreements\\nGuidelines for the production of the uniform Eurocheque\\n(22) According to the guidelines, the production of Eurocheques may be assigned only to firms (paper mills and printing plants) that have experience in the production of high-security printed instruments (such as banknotes, travellers' cheques, etc.), the necessary technical equipment and effective security and control facilities (Article 2.1).\\n(23) Applications for authorization must be addressed to Eurocheque International; authorization is granted by the Eurocheque Assembly. The authorization expires if no orders are executed during a period of two years (Article 2 (8)) (three years for Eurocheque cards).\\n(24) The informations and key materials required for the production of the paper and the printing of the Eurocheques are supplied exclusively by Eurocheque International on receipt of proof of an order. Only these materials may be used (Articles 4, 6 (2) and 7 (2)). The detailed specifications are then communicated immediately, followed by the key materials after an appropriate period for production and delivery, which Eurocheque International envisages will not exceed four weeks save in exceptional circumstances.\\nIn the event of failure to comply with the guidelines, Eurocheque International may demand the surrender of the materials supplied and any means of production deriving from them, as well as any finished or semi-finished products, against reimbursement of the costs (Article 2 (7)).\\n(1) OJ No 13, 21. 2. 1962, p. 204/62.\\n(2) OJ No C 156, 15. 6. 1988, p. 2.\\n(1) In this Decision 'bank' embraces all credit institutions which are members of the Eurocheque system.\\n(2) OJ No L 35, 7. 2. 1985, p. 43.\\n(1) In the published version of the Decision, some information has hereinafter been omitted, pursuant to the provisions of Article 21 of Regulation No 17 concerning non-disclosure of business secrets.\\n(25) Authorization is subject to a prior inspection by representatives of Eurocheque International (Article 2 (3)) Paper manufacturers and printing shops are required, prior to the first production, to submit samples for inspection and approval to Eurocheque International or its representatives (Articles 6 (3) and 7 (4)) Eurocheque International is prepared to come to a decision within a period of two weeks.\\n(26) Producers (paper mills and printing plants) authorized to produce, store and dispatch Eurocheques and cards must have effective security systems and Eurocheque control measures in order to rule out any improper use or theft of materials, paper or finished or semi-finished products. The measures are detailed in a memorandum annexed to the guidelines.\\n(27) Eurocheque International or its representatives have the right to inspect at any time the production facilities as well as the books and records in order to ensure that the guidelines are being effectively observed (Article 8 (2)).\\n(28) Orders for Eurocheques may be accepted by approved printers only if given by institutions whose right to place an order has been confirmed in writing to the printer by the national liaison office of the institution which placed the order (Article 3). A printer's customer is a bank which is a member of the Eurocheque Community. The production of paper may be effected only by order of authorized printers, the names of which have been given to the paper manufacturers by Eurocheque International (Article 6).\\nGuidelines for the production of the uniforme Eurocheque card\\n(29) These guidelines concern the production and printing of the special paper and the production of special security features involved in the manufacture of the Eurocheque card. Apart from the difference referred to in point 23, the layout and wording of these guidelines are very similar, mutatis mutandis, to those of the guidelines for the production of cheques.\\nGuidelines for the finishing of the uniform Eurocheque and the uniform Eurocheque card\\n(30) Finishing involves the insertion of the bank's name, the personalization and encoding of cheques and cards, lamination of cards, attachment of the signature panel on the cards and other special features, such as the hologram.\\n(31) Eurocheque instruments can be finished either by member financial institutions or by specialized firms. Authorization is granted under similar conditions to those governing the approval of paper manufacturers and printers: the finishing firms must have the necessary equipment and effective security facilities.\\n(32) However, applications for authorization must be addressed to the Eurocheque asssociation of the country of the applicant. Where a country has no financial institution which issues uniform Eurocheques (this applies only to Greece among the Member States), the application is addressed to the association of a country which does have such a financial institution. Authorization for the finishing of Eurocheques is given by the national association whereas authorization for the production of instruments is granted by the Eurocheque Assembly and Eurocheque International. Eurocheque International is informed by the national associations of all authorizations granted by them.\\n(33) Authorization is limited to finishing operations in respect of which the firm fulfils the appropriate requirements. There are at present ( . . . ) firms authorized to carry out one or more finishing operations, in 12 countries, of which seven are EEC Member States.\\nII. LEGAL ASSESSMENT\\nA. Article 85 (1)\\n(34) The guidelines are agreements within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty. The agreements between the national associations must be regarded as agreements between undertakings as these agreements determine the conduct of the undertakings which the associations represent.\\n(35) According to the guidelines, and the agreements concluded between Eurocheque International or the national associations with authorized undertakings, the banks obtain cheques and cards from authorized printers exclusively, and they in turn may only obtain Eurocheque paper exclusively from authorized paper producers. Similarly, banks may only obtain finishing services from untertakings authorized for finishing work.\\nConversely, authorized undertakings may only supply Eurocheque instruments, Eurocheque paper or finishing services to member banks or authorized printers, as appropriate.\\n(36) The Eurocheque system is an international payment system set up by a large number of European credit institutions. It is of the utmost importance to the smooth running of the system and to retain the confidence of customers, whether consumers, traders or member banks, that a high level of security be maintained. That means that the quality of the instruments must not only be high, but also uniform. For these reasons the prior vetting of firms wishing to produce Eurocheque instruments is essential. The selection criteria are objective and qualitative. However, as regards the security of premises in particular, the criteria allow for a fairly wide margin of discretion. It would, for example, be counter-productive for the guidelines to specify electronic protection devices or even to standardize them in any way. Nevertheless the application of these criteria and the processing of applications for authorization by the central bodies of the Eurocheque Community offer certain guarantees as to the uniform application of the guidelines to paper manufacturers and printers.\\n(37) The Commission considers that both the prior authorization of paper manufacturers and printers and the qualitative criteria applied are justified by the nature of the products or services to be provided, and by the security which is indispensable for the proper operation of the Eurocheque system. The authorization scheme ensures that those undertakings which fulfil the necessary conditions will be authorized if they so request. Banks and printers do not therefore have any legitimate interest in resorting to non-authorized undertakings. Accordingly, the Commission considers that the obligation imposed on banks and on printers to obtain Eurocheque instruments and paper exclusively from authorized printers and paper producers does not amount to a restriction of competition within the meaning of Article 85 (1).\\n(38) By virtue of the principles governing subcontracting, the obligation imposed on paper producers and printers to supply Eurocheque paper or instruments only to designated purchasers does not amount to a restriction of competition within the meaning of Article 85 (1).\\n(39) It is necessary to restrict the distribution of technical specifications and materials used in the production of Eurocheque instruments or which could facilitate forgeries by giving them only to firms able to show proof of an order. This measure is not a significant barrier to the access of new firms to the production of Eurocheque instruments, as the firms can make provision in their forecasts for the delays such a measure involves.\\n(40) all finishing firms are required to address an application for authorization to one national association as stated in point 32. The authorization determines whether the firm is able to provide finishing services not only to the banks in the country where it is given but also to those in all countries of the Eurocheque Community.\\n(41) When a finishing firm is authorized the national association concerned bears the costs of examining the application and of carrying out the obligatory regular on-the-spot inspections. Furthermore, the association could incur liability in connection with the examination of applications and the obligation to carry out regular checks in the event of a finishing firm failing to comply with security requirements. The Commission's investigations in this case found that national associations regard the above factors as important. These associations are extremely diverse in terms of their financial and human resources and in their likely assessment of the risks and costs which they are ready to bear. There is no doubt that differences will arise in the application of the criteria which involve complex assessments of risk, and that these differences are likely to be significant.\\n(42) In the light of these considerations, the Commission considers that the obligation on banks to obtain finishing services only from authorized firms amounts to a restriction of competition within the meaning of Article 85 (1), for the authorization scheme does not assure the elaboration of a uniform standard and the authorization of all firms which would meet that standard and wish to provide Eurocheque finishing services. On the contrary, taken as a whole, the prior approval system for finishing firms is inherently liable to lead to discrimination between firms. As a consequence, banks will be unable to obtain finishing services from certain firms which should qualify for authorization.\\nEffect on trade between Member States\\n(43) Any lack of uniformity in the application of the system of authorizing finishing firms is inherently liable to affect trade between Member States since the authorization granted by the national Eurocheque association determines the market access of finishing services throughout the member countries of the Eurocheque Community, which currently includes all the Community countries except Greece.\\n(44) The finishers of Eurocheque instruments can receive orders from banks in other countries, even if the cost of providing security transport means that trade has to be limited chiefly to transactions with neighbouring countries. B. Article 85 (3)\\n(45) While the prohibition on obtaining finishing services from non-authorized firms falls within the scope of the prohibition in Article 85 (1), the guidelines on finishing may be exempted under Article 85 (3).\\nThe prior authorization of finishing firms does promote economic progress in that it contributes to the security of the Eurocheque system as a means of international payment. Security is an essential factor in the development of the system and in retaining user confidence, which is indispensable in payment systems.\\n(46) The users of the Eurocheque system obtain a fair share of the resulting benefit since a high level of security reduces the risk of the heavy costs which may result both directly and indirectly from counterfeiting and forgery in payment systems. In addition, Eurocheque bearers benefit from the widespread acceptance of Eurocheques by banks and traders in European and Mediterranean countries which is fostered by the security of the system. Banks, for their part, are free to give finishing work to any authorized firm. They may also carry out the finishing work themselves if they consider it is more advantageous.\\n(47) The agreement does not impose any restrictions that are not essential in securing the advantages resulting from the agreement. Although implementation of the agreement by the national associations entails a risk of distortion of competition in the application of the authorization criteria, the structure is justifiable. The potential number of finishing firms is far greater than in the case of paper manufacturers and printers. Often these firms operate more on a regional than an international basis. The national associations are therefore in a better position to know and control them, and such decentralized control is also easier and less expensive.\\n(48) Lastly, the agreement does not afford the parties concerned the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question. The agreement does not govern trade relations between authorized firms and the member banks that are their customers. Both are entitled to submit or invite tenders in all the member countries. In addition, the finishing of Eurocheque instruments constitutes only a small part of the services that can be provided by firms which may be authorized to finish Eurocheque instruments.\\nC.

It should provide socioeconomic benefits for European citizens, contribute to the health of European citizens, increase the competitiveness of Europe and help to establish Europe as the most attractive place for biopharmaceutical research and development.\\n(10)\\nThe objective of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines should be to foster collaboration between all stakeholders such as industry, public authorities (including regulators), organisations of patients, academia and clinical centres. The Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines should define a commonly agreed research agenda (hereinafter referred to as Research Agenda) closely following the recommendations of the Strategic Research Agenda developed by the European Technology Platform on Innovative Medicines which identified efficacy, safety, knowledge management and training as important areas.\\n(11)\\nThe Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines should propose a coordinated approach to overcome identified research bottlenecks in the drug development process, and to support pre-competitive pharmaceutical research and development, in order to accelerate the development of safe and more effective medicines for patients. In the present context ‘pre-competitive pharmaceutical research and development’ should be understood as research on the tools and methodologies used in the drug development process.\\n(12)\\nThe Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines should deliver new approaches, methods and technologies, improve knowledge management of research results and data, and support the training of professionals. To this end, it is necessary to set up a Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines (hereinafter referred to as the IMI Joint Undertaking) as a legal entity.\\n(13)\\nThe objective of the IMI Joint Undertaking should be achieved through support of research activities by pooling resources from the public and private sectors. To this end, the IMI Joint Undertaking should be capable of organising competitive calls for proposals for supporting the research activities. Such research activities should respect fundamental ethical principles applicable in the Seventh Framework Programme.\\n(14)\\nThe IMI Joint Undertaking should be set up for a period up to 31 December 2017 to ensure the appropriate management of research activities initiated but not concluded during the Seventh Framework Programme (2007 to 2013).\\n(15)\\nThe IMI Joint Undertaking should be a body set up by the Community and discharge for the implementation of its budget should be given by the European Parliament, on the recommendation of the Council, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the budget of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as the Financial Regulation) (4) taking however into account the specificities resulting from the nature of joint technology initiatives as public-private partnerships and in particular from the private sector contribution to the budget.\\n(16)\\nFounding members of the IMI Joint Undertaking should be the Community and EFPIA.\\n(17)\\nEFPIA is a non-profit organisation representing the research based pharmaceutical industry in Europe. The aim of EFPIA is to ensure and promote the technological and economic development of the pharmaceutical industry in Europe. EFPIA is open for membership to national associations of research-based pharmaceutical companies, as well as directly to research-based pharmaceutical companies. It applies general principles of openness and transparency for membership ensuring a wide industrial involvement.\\n(18)\\nThe IMI Joint Undertaking should be open to new members.\\n(19)\\nThe rules for organisation and operation of the IMI Joint Undertaking should be laid down in the Statutes of the IMI Joint Undertaking as part of this Regulation.\\n(20)\\nA letter of commitment concerning the Statutes of the IMI Joint Undertaking has been signed by EFPIA and its research based pharmaceutical companies that are members of EFPIA.\\n(21)\\nThe research activities should be covered by funding from the Community and at least on an equal level by resources from the research based pharmaceutical companies that are members of EFPIA. Further financing options may be available, inter alia, from the European Investment Bank, in particular through the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility developed jointly with the EIB and the Commission pursuant to Annex III to Decision/2006/971/EC.\\n(22)\\nThe running costs of the IMI Joint Undertaking should be covered in equal amount by EFPIA and the Community.\\n(23)\\nTo ensure an equal partnership, the research based pharmaceutical companies that are members of EFPIA activities should not be eligible to receive financial support from the IMI Joint Undertaking.\\n(24)\\nThe IMI Joint Undertaking should adopt, in accordance with the Financial Regulation and subject to prior consent of the Commission, specific financial rules which take into account its specific operating needs arising, in particular, from the need to combine Community and private funding to support research and development activities in an efficient and timely manner. In order to ensure a harmonised treatment between the participants of the Joint Undertaking research activities and those of the indirect actions of the Seventh Framework Programme, it is appropriate that value added tax should not be an eligible cost for Community funding, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1906/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 laying down the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in actions under the Seventh Framework Programme and for the dissemination of research results (2007-2013) (5).\\n(25)\\nThe need to ensure stable employment conditions and equal treatment of staff, and in order to attract specialised scientific and technical staff of the highest calibre, requires the application of the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities laid down in Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 of the Council (6) to all staff recruited by the IMI Joint Undertaking.\\n(26)\\nAs a body possessing legal personality, the IMI Joint Undertaking should be accountable for its actions.

       " 92: \"*****\\nCOMMISSION DECISION\\nof 15 November 1988\\nrelating to aid which the Belgian Government has granted to a petrochemicals company at Ottignies/Louvain-la-Neuve (SA Belgian Shell)\\n(Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)\\n(89/254/EEC)\\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,\\nHaving given notice in accordance with the above Article to interested parties to submit their comments, and having regard to those comments,\\nWhereas:\\nI\\nBy letter dated 22 December 1987, received on 4 January 1988, the Belgian Government notified a plan to grant investment aid to SA Belgian Shell at Ottignies/Louvain-la-Neuve under the Expansion Law of 17 July 1959.\\nThe investment aid is to be granted for the creation of a research laboratory for the development of new, technologically advanced petrochemical products and the improvement of existing products such as epoxy resins, polyurethanes, elastomers, polypropylene, polyethylene, polybuthylene, polyvinyl chloride and expansible polystyrene. The research will also investigate new applications for these productsd. It is not planned to start production at Louvain-la-Neuve.\\nIn view of the considerable volume of trade in petrochemicals between Community countries, the Commission considered that the measure in question was an aid pursuant to Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty and that, according to the information at its disposal and that made available by the Belgian authorities, it did not prima facie satisfy the conditions for exemption pursuant to Aticle 92 (3). It therefore opened the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) in respect of that aid.\\nBy letter dated 11 February 1988 it gave the Belgian Government notice to submit its comments. Comments were also invited from the other Member States by letter dated 29 April and from other interested parties by letter dated 3 May 1988.\\nII\\nThe Belgian Government, in reply to the opening of the Article 93 (2) procedure, sent its comments by letter dated 7 April 1988, received on 14 April 1988.\\nIt argued that the laboratory to be assisted had been specifically designed to undertake basic and experimental applied research in order to identify and assess new potential applications and to develop, at the stage of basic industrial research, innovative high technology products capable of satisfying new, predetermined needs.\\nWithin the framework of the procedure, four other Member States, an enterprise in the relevant sector and one association submitted observations.\\nIII\\nThe measures proposed by the Belgian authorities consist in a direct grant of 15,6 % of planned investment (Bfrs 217 015 million in aid for an investment of Bfrs 1 391 125 million) and in a five-year exemption from property tax with a net grant equivalent of 9,56 %. The Community petrochemicals market is characterized by strong competition and considerable intra-Community trade.\\nThe petrochemicals industry in Europe comprises a large number of companies, both independent and subsidiaries of national and multinational chemical and oli companies, located in various Member States and emnploying between 550 000 and 600 000 pesons.\\nIn 1987, total turnover in the Community petrochemicals industry reached ECU 99 180 million. Exports to Member States accounted for ECU 39 800 million, or 40,13 % of turnover.\\nIn 1986, intra-Community trade in unsaturated ethylene and propene not for carburation or combustion attained a volume of ECU 693 million and 294 million respectively. The figures for unsaturated butenes, butadienes and methylbutadienes, and styrene were ECU 204 million and 457 million.\\nThe recipient of the planned aid, Belgian Shell, is one of the trading firms belonging to the Royal Dutch-Shell Group that are established in the Member States and market petroleum and petrochemical products manufactured at the Group's production centres in Europe. Thus the chief market for Belgian Shell is Belgium (94 % of petroleum products and 68 % of petrochemical products are sold in Belgium). The company obtains 17,4 % of its turnover from petrochemical products, of which 32 % were exported to other Member States in 1986.\\nIn view of the above considerations, the situation in the market in question and the position of the firm in question on that market, the aid envisaged is liable to affect trade between Member States and distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty by favouring the undertaking concerned.\\nWhen a State aid strengthens the position of some undertakings in relation to their competitors in the Community, it must be regarded as affecting such competitors.\\nThe aid in question distorts competition by reducing the cost of investing in the laboratory which gives the undertaking concerned a competitive advantage over other producers in the petrochemicals industry.\\nIV\\nArticle 92 (1) provides that aid meeting the criteria laid down therein is in principle incompatible with the common market. The exceptions provided for in Article 92 (2) are not applicable in this case because of the nature of the proposed assistance and its objectives.\\nAccording to Article 92 (3) of the Treaty, aid which may be regarded as compatible with the common market must be determined in the context of the Community as a whole and not in that of a single Member State. In order to ensure the proper functioning of the common market and having regard to the principle embodied in Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) must be construed narrowly when any aid scheme or any individual aid award is scrutinized.\\nIn particular, the exceptions may be invoked only when the Commission is satisfied that, without the aid, market forces alone would be insufficient to encourage the recipients to attain one of the objectives of the exceptions.\\nApplying the exceptions to cases not contributing to such an objective or where aid is not needed to this end would mean conferring advantages on the industries or undertakings of certain Member States, thus artificially strengthening their financial position, adversely affecting trading conditions between Member States and distorting competition without any justification based on grounds of the ocmmon interest referred to in Article 92 (3).\\nThe Belgian Government was unable to provide, and the Commission to find, any reason for classifying the aid in any of the categories of exception pursuant to Article 92 (3).\\nArticle 92 (3) (a) and (c) allows exceptions for aid that promotes or facilitates the development of certain areas, but there is no region in Belgium which has an abnormally low standard of living or serious underemployment within the meaning of subparagraph (c); as regards the exception in subparagraph (c), the Ottignies/Louvain-la-Neuve area in the province of Brabant where the investment in question is located, was not included in special regional aid zones in Commission Decision 82/740/EEC (1) on the definition of development areas in Belgium.\\nAs for the exceptions provided for in subparagraph (b) of Article 92 (3), it is clear that the aid is not intended to promote the execution of a project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the Belgian economy. A specific aid for a single company in the petrochemicals sector would not remedy the type of situaitons described in Article 93 (3) (b), and the Belgian Government has not put forward any such justification for the aid in question. The Commission has therefore come\\nto the same conclusions as those contained in the Court of Justice Judgment of 8 March 1988 in joined Cases 62/87 and 72/87, point 22 et seq.\\nAs to the exception in Article 92 (3) (c) for aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, it must be concluded that whilst the aid facilitates the development of the undertaking in question, at the same time it affects trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.\\nAs the Community framework for State aids for research and development shows (1), the Commission is in favour of aid for research or development projects.\\nThe aid in question, however, is not aimed at financing certain specific R & D projects but contributes essentially to the purchase of land and the construction of a building to house the laboratory in question (86,9 % of total cost of project). The purchase of scientific and data-processing equipment, however, represents only 13,1 % of total costs. Furthermore, although the laboratory will be carrying out so-called 'experimental' industrial basic and applied research, in the sense that its planned to establish a permanent dialogue with universities and industry, it will initially be given traditional petrochemical development work, including techniques for the application of polymers.\\nThe activities of the company building the laboratory to be assisted are limited to marketing the petroleum and petrochemical products of Royal Dutch-Shell. As a result, the exploitation of the results of the research conducted in the laboratory will be entrusted to the Group's various production centres. Thus aid granted to the laboratory would benefit not Shell but also the whole Royal Dutch-Shell group.\\nThe Community petrochemicals market is affected by a certain degree of instability reflected in large cyclical fluctuations of supply and demand. The overcapacity which arose in the second half of the 1970s led to a crisis in the early 1980s entailing extensive losses. Although the sector has now returned to profit, following capacity cuts and a rise in demand, capacity increases in certain sub-sectors such as propylene and ethylene and the emergence of new non-Community producers (Gulf countries, South-East Asia, Eastern Europe) is liable to lead once again to overcapacity.\\nIt is in the interest of any company in the sector wishing to maintain or improve its position on the market to identify and assess new potential applications for petrochemical products and to design new products.\\nIn view of the difficult market situation that could arise with the appearance of overcapacity and the arrival of new producers, approval of the proposal to grant aid for the Belgian Shell laboratory would mean putting its competitors at a disadvantage which could cause an unjustified drop in their sales and/or compel them in the medium term to withdraw from the market.\\nTaking account of the financial position of the parent company and its interest in having the laboratory, it is concluded that the aid in question is not necessary and that market forces alone should suffice for the investment to be achieved without an aid grant.\\nConsequently, the aid in question does not facilitate the development of the industry in question and alters trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (c).\\nThe aid proposed by the Belgian Government does not therefore meet the conditions required for application of any of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty,\\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\\nArticle 1\\nBelgium shall not implement the proposal notified to the Commission by letter dated 22 December 1987 to grant aid for an investment programme implemented at Ottignies/Louvain-la-Neuve by SA Belgian Shell.\\nArticle 2\\nBelgium shall inform the Commission, within two months of the notification of this Decision, of the measures it has taken to comply therewith.\\nArticle 3\\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium.\\nDone at Brussels, 15 November 1988.\",\n",

The transferee should be designated before a certificate is applied for.\\n(3) Operators retain their refund right if they have complied with the applicable rules and have not made a specific refund application within three months of the date on which the customs authority accepted the export declaration. In such cases, the guarantee or part thereof corresponding to the refund certificate is retained.\\n(4) There must be specific provisions covering refund certificates in the case of an open invitation to tender in a non-member country in order to enable European operators to submit a bid on competitive terms. However, for the sake of simplification, the procedure must be based largely on what is already provided for in Article 49 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2001(6).\\n(5) For reasons of administrative simplification, special procedures should be laid down for the release of the guarantee, including in particular the conditions for partial release and a threshold below which a guarantee that should have been retained may be released.\\n(6) In order to make full use of the scope for exporting agricultural products that benefit from refunds, there must be provisions similar to those set out in Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 and operators must be encouraged to swiftly return certificates that have not been fully used throughout the budget period.\\n(7) Because of the amendments under this Regulation, the references to the Articles of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 will need to be adapted.\\n(8) With a view to more efficient use of the funds available, particularly in view of the need for the Community to meet its international commitments, there must be procedures for adapting the threshold above which the exemption from presenting certificates for certain exporters no longer applies. It is also necessary to make special arrangements to enable operators that no longer wish to take advantage of the exemption from presenting certificates when a budgetary period is changed to make efficient use of the threshold provided for in Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the Community\\'s international commitments have been met by the end of a budget year, there must be procedures for suspending payments in connection with refund certificates issued during the corresponding budget period.\\n(9) Given the experience acquired since the introduction of refund certificates, the procedures provided for in Annex F to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 need to be adapted.\\n(10) It has to be possible to apply some of the provisions of this Regulation as from 9 July.

Exporters who have submitted or wish to submit a tender in response to an invitation to tender as referred to in paragraph 1 may, by way of derogation from Article 8(5), (6) and (9), subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 10, and provided the conditions specified in paragraph 3 are fulfilled, apply for one or more certificates, which will be issued subject to the exporter being awarded a contract.\\n3. This Article shall apply only if the following particulars at least are specified in the invitation to tender:\\n- the importing country and the agency issuing the invitation to tender,\\n- the closing date for the submission of tenders,\\n- the specific quantity of products covered by the invitation to tender.\\nThe party concerned shall communicate these particulars to the issuing agency when applying for the certificate.\\nAn application or applications for a certificate may not be lodged more than 15 days before the closing date for the submission of tenders but must be lodged at the latest by 1 p.m. on that closing date.\\nThe amount in respect of which the certificate or certificates are applied for may not exceed the corresponding quantity applying the rate fixed in advance in accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, specified in the invitation to tender. No account shall be taken of tolerances or options provided for in the invitation to tender.\\n4. Notwithstanding Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) 1291/2000, the security need not be lodged when the certificate is applied for.\\n5. Within 44 days of the closing date for submitting tenders, except in case of force majeure, the applicant shall inform the issuing body by letter or by written telecommunication, to reach the issuing body no later than the date of expiry of the 44-day time limit:\\n(a) either that he has himself been awarded a contract;\\n(b) or that he has not been awarded a contract;\\n(c) or that he has not submitted a tender;\\n(d) or that he is not in a position to know the outcome of the invitation to tender within the time limit specified for reasons which may not be ascribed to him.\\n6. Applications for certificates shall not be accepted where, during the period of issue to which applications for refund certificates are subject, the issue of a certificate has been suspended in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 8(8).\\nNo special measure taken subsequent to the expiry of the said period may prevent the issue of one or more certificates in respect of the invitation to tender in question where the applicant has fulfilled the following conditions:\\n(a) the information referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 is evidenced by the appropriate documents;\\n(b) proof is furnished of the applicant\\'s having been awarded a contract;\\n(c) the contract is presented; or\\n(d) where absence of the contract is justified, documentation is submitted attesting the obligations entered into with the other contracting party or parties, including confirmation from his or their bank of the opening of an irrevocable documentary letter of credit by the purchaser\\'s financial institution relating to the agreed delivery;\\n(e) the security required for the issue of the certificate is lodged.\\nThe certificate or certificates shall be issued only for the country referred to in the first indent of the first subparagraph of paragraph 3.

Refund certificates shall be valid for no longer than the end of the eighth month following the month of issue or until 30 September of each year, which ever is the sooner. Rates fixed in advance are therefore valid until the last day of the certificate\\'s validity.\\nNo certificate may be issued for the amount corresponding to the quantity for which the applicant has not been awarded a contract or has failed to comply with any of the conditions specified in point (a), (b), (c) and (e) of the second subparagraph or, as the case may be, point (a), (b), (d) and (e) of the second subparagraph.\\nThe holder of the certificate or certificates shall be held primarily liable for the repayment of any refund incorrectly paid where it is established that the certificate or certificates was or were issued on the basis of a contract or obligation, specified in point (d), not corresponding to the invitation to tender opened by the non-member country.\\n7. In the cases referred to in paragraph 5(b), (c) and (d), no certificate shall be issued in connection with the application referred to in paragraph 3.\\n8.

(a) If the successful tenderer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the agency that issued the invitation to tender has cancelled the contract for reasons which are not attributable to the tenderer and are not considered to constitute force majeure, the competent authority shall release the security in cases where the rate of the refund fixed in advance in respect of the basic product corresponding to the largest refund compared with the other basic products used is higher than or equal to the rate of the refund valid on the last day of the certificate\\'s validity.\\n(b) If the successful tenderer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the agency that issued the invitation to tender has obliged him to accept changes to the contract for reasons that are not attributable to him and are not considered to constitute force majeure, the competent authority may extend the validity of the certificate and the duration of advance fixing up to 30 September.\\n(c) If the successful tenderer furnishes proof that the invitation to tender or the contract concluded following the award provided for a downward tolerance or option of more than 5 % and that the agency that issued the invitation to tender is invoking the relevant clause, the obligation to export shall be deemed to have been fulfilled where the quantity exported is not more than 10 % less than the quantity corresponding to the amount for which the certificate was issued, on condition that the rate of the refund fixed in advance in respect of the basic product corresponding to the largest refund compared with the other basic products used is higher than or equal to the rate of the refund valid on the last day of validity of the certificate. In such cases the rate of 95 % referred to in Article 12(4) shall be replaced by 90 %.\\n(d) In comparing the rate of the refund fixed in advance with that of the refund valid on the last day of validity of the certificate, account shall be taken, where applicable, of other amounts provided for under Community rules.\\n10.

In the case of applications which have not yet been submitted, the Commission may suspend application of paragraph 2 under the conditions set out in the second and third subparagraphs of Article 8(8).\\n12. For the purposes of applying the first subparagraph of paragraph 6, the Commission may consider that there is no danger of international commitments not being met if the sum of the amounts corresponding to a single invitation to tender for which one or more applications for certificates have been made by one or more operators and for which no certificate has yet been issued does not exceed EUR 2 million.\\nHowever, this limit may be increased to EUR 4 million if none of the reduction coefficients published since the beginning of the budgetary period and referred to in Article 8(5) exceeds 50 %.\\nRefund certificates shall not be issued to operators if the amount concerned, added to the amounts for which certificates have been applied for as part of the same invitation to tender, exceed the applicable limit.\"\\n5. Article 12 is replaced by the following: \"Article 12\\n1.

The security shall be released in full once the holder of the certificate has applied for refunds totalling 95 % of the amount for which the certificate was issued. On application by the titular holder, Member States may release the security by instalments in proportion to the quantities of products for which proof as referred to in Article 7(4) has been produced, provided that proof has been produced that an amount equal to at least 5 % of that indicated on the certificate has been applied for.\\n4. Where the refund certificate has been used for less than 95 % of the amount for which it was issued, part of the security equal to 25 % of the difference between 95 % of the amount for which the certificate was issued and the amount of refunds actually used shall be forfeited.\\nFurthermore, if the total amount of the security which would be forfeited comes to EUR 60 or less for a given certificate, the Member State concerned shall release the whole of the security.\\n5. However,\\n- where the certificate or an extract from the certificate is returned to the issuing body within a period corresponding to the initial two thirds of its term of validity, the corresponding amount of security to be forfeited shall be reduced by 40 %; for this purpose, any part of a day counts as a whole day;\\n- where the certificate or extract from the certificate is returned to the issuing body within a period corresponding to the last third of its term of validity or during the month following the expiry date, the corresponding amount of security to be forfeited shall be reduced by 25 %.\\nThe above paragraph shall apply only to certificates and extracts from certificates returned to the issuing body during the budgetary period in respect of which the certificates have been issued, provided that they are returned more than 30 days before the end of that period.\"\\n6. In Article 14, paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the following: \"2.

The applications submitted by the operator on the terms set out in Annex F-VI, paragraph 2, during the budget year and before the submission of the application for the export in question must total less than EUR 50000.\\nFor the application of the previous subparagraph, if the specific application is regarded by the competent authority as being the customs declaration within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, the date of the application may, if the competent authority agrees, be the date on which the customs authority accepted the export declaration in question.\\nThis Article is applicable only in the Member State in which the goods are manufactured or assembled.\\n3. Member States shall notify the Commission no later than the fifth day of each month of the amounts of the refunds granted pursuant to this Article from the sixteenth day to the end of the previous month, and no later than the twentieth day of each month of the amounts of the refunds granted pursuant to this Article from the first to the fifteenth day of the current month.\\nIf the sum of the amounts notified by the Member States reaches 20 million euro, the Commission can suspend the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article to exports not covered by a refund certificate.\\nTaking into account both the amounts notified by Member States in application of the first subparagraph and the European Community\\'s meeting of international commitments, the Commission may adjust the amount provided for in the second subparagraph in respect of a budgetary period, in which case it shall publish the new amount in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\"\\n7.

In addition, it is intended to exempt the supplies and intra-Community acquisitions of non-ferrous metal waste, regardless of the trader\\'s gross turnover.\\n(4) Taxable persons whose transactions are covered by the exemptions set out in the special tax measures may, subject to the conditions laid down by the Hellenic Republic, be authorised not to apply the exemptions to their transactions.\\n(5) These special tax measures constitute an effective fraud-prevention measure in a sector in which collecting VAT is rendered particularly awkward by the difficulty of identifying and supervising activities.\\n(6) These special tax measures therefore satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC.\\n(7) In its communication of 7 June 2000 to the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission published a strategy to improve the operation of the VAT system in the short term including a rationalisation of the large number of derogations currently in force. In some cases, however, this rationalisation could involve extending particularly effective derogations to all Member States.\\n(8) It therefore seems advisable to grant the derogation until 31 December 2003, thereby permitting an assessment of its compatibility with the overall approach to the system of VAT, and in particular the rationalisation of derogations.\\n(9) The derogation has no adverse impact on the European Communities\\' own resources accruing from VAT,\\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\\nArticle 1\\nBy way of derogation from Directive 77/388/EEC, the Hellenic Republic is hereby authorised to apply until 31 December 2003 special measures for the taxation of recyclable waste (hereafter called \"the special regime\").\\nArticle 2\\nBy way of derogation from Article 2 of Directive 77/388/EEC, the following shall be exempt from VAT:\\n(a) supplies of recyclable waste, such as scrap iron, waste of iron and steel, glass, paper and board, by traders with a turnover of less than EUR 900000;\\n(b) supplies of non-ferrous metals.\\nArticle 3\\nBy way of derogation from Article 28a(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the following shall be exempt from VAT:\\n(a) intra-Community acquisitions of recyclable waste, such as scrap iron, waste of iron and steel, glass, paper and board, by traders with a turnover of less than EUR 900000;\\n(b) intra-Community acquisitions of non-ferrous metals.\\nArticle 4\\nIn order to calculate the ceiling of EUR 900000 under Articles 2 and 3, the turnover for non-ferrous metals may be disregarded.\\nArticle 5\\nThe Hellenic Republic shall allow those taxable persons who so request it, not to apply the special regime to their supplies and intra-Community acquisitions, under such conditions as it may see fit to ensure that the VAT obligations of the taxable person are properly met.\\nArticle 6\\nThis Decision is addressed to the Hellenic Republic.\\nDone at Brussels, 12 July 2002.',\n",
